    A movement to go back to the origins of the hobby which, in

    Described in the [Principia Apocrypha](https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html) as:

    > The more of the following a campaign has, the more old school it
    > is: high lethality, an open world, a lack of pre-written plot,
    > an emphasis on creative problem solving, an exploration-centered
    > reward system (usually XP for treasure), a disregard for
    > "encounter balance", and the use of random tables to generate
    > world elements that surprise both players and referees.  Also, a
    > strong do-it-yourself attitude and a willingness to share your
    > work and use the creativity of others in your game.
