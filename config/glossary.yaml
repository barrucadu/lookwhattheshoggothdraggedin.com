    A horror investigation roleplaying game based on the fiction of
    [H. P. Lovecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft).
    First published in 1981 by [Chaosium](https://www.chaosium.com/),
    and now in its seventh edition.

    Unlike [glo:dnd], Call of Cthulhu has no classes or levels and has
    an extensive skill list.  The default setting is the 1920s, often
    in the USA, but supplements exist for different periods and
    locations.

dice-notation:
  title: Dice Notation
  text: |
    Dice rolls are expressed in the form `NdS`, where `N` is the
    number of dice to roll and `S` is the size of die.  Modifiers can
    be given with `+M` or `-M`.  Usually the values of the dice are
    summed to get the result.

    For example, `3d10+7` means "roll three 10-sided dice, sum them,
    and add 7 to the result".

    There are two common exceptions:

      - `d100`, or "percentile dice".  Very few people own an actual
        100-sided die, so usually this is done by rolling `2d10` and
        designating one die the "tens" place and the other the "ones"
        place.  Or equivalently, rolling `10*d10 + d10`.

        For example, rolling a 3 and a 7 is read as 37.

        A roll of 0 on both dice is read as 100.

      - `d66`, `d666`, and so on.  Similarly to percentile dice, this
        usually means to roll multiple dice and read them as digits of
        a larger number.

        For example, rolling a 1, a 3, and a 6 is read as 136.

        Since a `d6` is numbered from 1 to 6, the results of a `d66`
        (for example) do not cover all values from 1 to 66.

gm:

  abbr: GM
  text: |
    The player at the table who plays the part of "the world", rather
    than controlling a specific [glo:pc].  The GM will describe the
    events taking place, decide what happens when outcomes are
    uncertain and control [glo:npc]s.  Traditionally the GM will also
    handle out-of-game concerns like scheduling.

    The GM is not *opposed* to the PCs; they're not trying to win or
    to score points against the other players.  Even though they have
    a different role, they are still a player.

    These will be your shopkeepers, guards, aristocrats, monsters, and
    so on.

    A movement to go back to the origins of the hobby which, in
    practice, usually means games based on early editions of
    [glo:dnd].

    Described in the [Principia Apocrypha](https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html):

    > The more of the following a campaign has, the more old school it
    > is: high lethality, an open world, a lack of pre-written plot,
    > an emphasis on creative problem solving, an exploration-centered
    > reward system (usually XP for treasure), a disregard for
    > "encounter balance", and the use of random tables to generate
    > world elements that surprise both players and referees.  Also, a
    > strong do-it-yourself attitude and a willingness to share your
    > work and use the creativity of others in your game.

    A character in the game world which is controlled by one of the
    players at the table.  Usually each player has exactly one PC,
    which they have exclusive control over, but that is not
    necessarily the case.
