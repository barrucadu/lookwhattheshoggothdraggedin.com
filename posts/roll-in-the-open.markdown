One really common piece of [abbr:gm] advice is to roll your dice behind
a screen, so your players can't see what you got.

This lets you decide if what you rolled is actually what's best for
the story right now, and to adjust the result if it's not.  For
example, to prevent the Big Bad you've been hyping up for the campaign
fumbling their dodge and being unceremoniously slaughtered in a single
round of combat.  This is called "fudging".

I completely disagree.


## Why do we roll dice?

Apocalypse World, a game I don't particularly like but which has some
good ideas, says in its [abbr:gm] Principles:

> In order to play to find out what happens, you'll need to pass
> decision-making off sometimes.  Whenever something comes up that
> you'd prefer not to decide by personal whim and will, don't.  The
> game gives you four key tools you can use to disclaim
> responsibility: [...]

In Apocalypse World, the [abbr:gm] can't just call for a roll, and when a
mechanic *is* triggered it's the player who rolls, not the [abbr:gm].
The system is fudge-proof by design, and doesn't seem to suffer for
it.

Why do we have dice, cards, bags of tokens, or any other randomiser in
an RPG?  It's so we can *disclaim decision-making*.

Sometimes it's just more
fun to play to find out what happens, rather than to decide by
[abbr:gm] fiat.


## The two flavours of fudge

There are two distinct situations which can call for a roll:

1. When the rules require it.  For example, most games have fairly
   strict combat rules which give specific options the players can
   choose from, and corresponding dice rolls which must be made.

2. When the [abbr:gm] wants to disclaim decision-making.  For example,
   a [abbr:pc] is trying to bluff their way past a guard, but both
   success and failure would be interesting outcomes, so the [abbr:gm]
   doesn't want to just pick one.

Many [abbr:gm "GMs"] treat fudging in these cases the same: if a dice roll
gives a "bad" result, fix it by saying you rolled something else.

But I don't think they're the same at all!

If the rules specify how to resolve a situation, and you fudge, you
are cheating.  I'm sorry, it's as simple as that.  If you want to use
some variant of the rules instead, you should discuss and agree that
explicitly with the players.

After all, you don't let *them* fudge *their* rolls, do you?

There's also a risk of making the players feel like their actions
don't really matter.  If the players succeed against all odds against
some terrible foe, and you tell them "great fight guys, you know, you
technically died three rounds back, but I decided to make the dragon
miss instead, and didn't that lead to such an *awesome* climax?",
doesn't that cheapen the victory?  A victory the players thought they
earned was, in fact, just given to them.

Even pro-fudging [abbr:gm "GMs"] recognise this, and advise that you should
never tell your players when you fudge.

On the other hand, if the [abbr:gm] called for a roll which they
weren't required to, and isn't happy with the all of the possible
results, well, maybe they shouldn't have called for it.  That's an
understandable mistake, and certainly one I've made.


## When do we roll dice?

So, a [abbr:pc] wants to do something, and you're not in a situation
where the rules dictate what to do.  Before calling for a roll, ask
yourself: **is the outcome in doubt?**

### The success of the action is in doubt

Are there consequences for failure?  If there aren't any, or if the
[abbr:pc] can just keep trying with no consequences, then it's not
*really* in doubt: they can just succeed automatically.

It's the combination of challenge and potential consequence which
makes this a situation worthy of a roll.  Keep that in mind and you'll
never end up in a situation where the player fails the roll and you
have nothing to say.

### Success is a given, but how good the success is is in doubt

For example, if the bard wants to tell the story of the last stand of
the king's son, they will succeed (telling stories well is what a bard
does).  But you might want to roll to see if they manage to bring the
king to tears.

Tell the player that they succeed, and what they're now rolling for:

> Ok, you launch into your tale, and soon the audience is entranced.
> You glance over at the king and see he is literally on the edge of
> his seat.  Roll performance to see how moved he is.

### Failure is a given, but how bad the failure is is in doubt

If the barbarian wants to threaten the king into surrendering his
crown, they will fail (you don't get to remain king if you give it up
to random wanderers).  But you might want to roll to determine whether
the king decides that this great hulking beast of a man might be a
good addition to his troops, or whether to just have him dragged to
the dungeons.

Tell the player that they fail, and what they're now rolling for:

> The king looks at you like you're mad, but there's also a
> calculating glint in his eye.  Roll intimidation to see if you might
> have impressed him with your bluster.


## Rolling in the open?

I've talked a lot about *fudging* here, but the title is about
*rolling in the open*.  Rolling in the open prevents you from fudging,
but it's not necessary.  What gives?

Well, I also roll in the open.  I figure that if I'm not going to
fudge, there's little point in hiding my rolls.

Some people advise hiding all your rolls so that players don't know if
they've succeeded at something, and so avoid metagaming.  A common
example is skill dogpiling, where one character says "I want to search
the room", and fails; then their companion says "I also want to search
the room", and fails; then yet another member of the party says they
also want to search the room!

You can solve dogpiling without hiding your rolls.  Just tell the
players that they can't, unless there is some special reason *in the
fiction* why their character would want to do an additional search.
After all, don't they trust their party members?

But I've been fortunate so far to have players who are fine with
keeping player knowledge and character knowledge separate.  They're
even good with character secrets, without me needing to pass around
hidden notes.

Maybe my opinion would be different if I had players who were less
good at that but, for now at least, hiding my rolls doesn't gain me
anything, whereas rolling in the open keeps me honest and *shows* that
I'm being honest.
