The Fog-spawn (or Thing in the Fog) is an other-dimensional creature
from the *Masks of Nyarlathotep* campaign for [glo:coc].  If you're a
player in that campaign, turn back now: there will be spoilers!

## Now that the players are gone...

The approach I'm taking in this post is to asume that the Fog-spawn is
an *evolved* creature, with instincts and tactics based on its natural
environment.  It's been pulled into an unfamiliar place, our
dimension, through magic: so it'll have to adapt.

First, let's start by listing what we know:

- **It has very low intelligence,** but it *does have* an intelligence
  stat, so it's more than just a beast of pure instinct.

- **It doesn't need to feed** (at least, by earthly timescales), so
  it's probably not an active hunter.

- **It's invisible,** so it's probably an ambush hunter.

- **It has six tentacles, and can attack with all of them
  independently,** so when prey are present it probably tries to take
  them all out at once.

- **It's fast,** so it can chase after any victims which escape.

- **It has high POW,** meaning it can resist spells easily, but **it
  doesn't know any spells itself.**

- **It's invulnerable to physical harm,** but bright light drives it off.

Based on that, here's a likely profile of the Fog-spawn's natural
environment and behaviour:

> Its natural habitat is dark, it waits silently and invisibly for
> victims to approach, whereupon it grabs and starts choking as many
> of them as it can.  If there are fewer than 6 victims, it'll use the
> left-over tentacles to restrain them, likely starting with the
> biggest (with only 5 INT it's only smart enough to use a basic proxy
> for strength, such as physical size).
>
> After killing the victims it's currently holding, it can chase after
> any which escaped (or which it couldn't first grab), choking and
> killing them too.  But, since it doesn't need much food, it won't
> chase very far if it's already made a kill, and it won't chase
> before killing the victims it's currently holding as that would risk
> losing them too.  It then eats its fill, and sits around waiting for
> a few more centuries.

This approach would work in our dimension too, especially as we're not
used to invisible tentacle monsters.  But there are two extra things
it's got to contend with:

- **Its tentacles are very weak compared to human strength.**

    A tentacle has 25 STR, and the average investigator has 52.5.  So
    even when grappled by two tentacles, an investigator still has a
    reasonable chance of escape.

    Prey in the Fog-spawn's home dimension must be pretty weak if a
    single tentacle is a viable threat, so it's used to being able to
    just add a tentacle or two to restrain larger victims.  So as
    investigators start breaking free, it'll concentrate its tentacles
    on the largest one.  Only when that investigator is fully
    restrained will it start grabbing the next smallest one.

    The weak tentacles could be explained by the Fog-spawn normally
    only eating small animals and suchlike.  But I don't think that's
    possible.  They wouldn't be a useful summoned monster, as they'd
    have an aversion to bigger creatures (like people).  No, a
    Fog-spawn must be used to human-sized prey, and normally be able
    to overpower such prey with one or two tentacles.

- **Bright light sends it back to its home dimension.**

    This could be a purely magical effect, relating to the means of
    summoning it into our dimension, but in that case if a spellcaster
    could overcome this one issue the Fog-spawn would be totally
    invulnerable!

    No, I think it's more likely that bright light *hurts* the
    Fog-spawn.  Enough bright light would kill it but, since it
    doesn't need to feed, it has very little tolerance for pain and
    will retreat as soon as it takes even a little damage.

    Since the Fog-spawn cannot come back from its native dimension
    unaided, it doesn't seem likely that it's opening a magical gate
    or anything.  More likely, with its high POW and the fear of the
    light, it's able to resist the summoning / binding spell holding
    it in our dimension.

So, that's pretty much it for how it fights: it's an ambush predator,
which uses its invisibility and speed to attack unsuspecting victims;
it tries to choke as many victims as it can (up to 6), using left-over
tentacles to restrain larger victims; and it concentrates tentacles on
victims which are strong enough to break free.

I like using characteristics like the size of the player characters,
because it's something that players don't think about very often, even
though it's really obvious to the characters themselves.

### Beyond combat

The last thing to talk about is the Fog-spawn's intelligence.  It has
5 INT, which is low, but it's smarter than, say, a dog.  It has a
miniscule chance of solving a puzzle, or doing some other
reasoning-based task.

In *Masks of Nyarlathotep*, the cult might send a Fog-spawn after the
investigators in London.  London is a pretty busy city, so clearly the
Fog-spawn is supposed to be smart enough to know who and who not to
attack, and to be able to track them down.

I think that its intelligence isn't enough for it to significantly
adjust its combat tactics---it's got one trick, and that normally
works well for it---but it is enough to somewhat train it, and give it
simple commands like to hunt down and attack a particular
investigator.  Though I think it would have to do that hunting based
on clearly apparent information, like colour or smell, and the
Fog-spawn would be easily confused by even changing your coat.

But this means that a Fog-spawn is a viable guard, if you donâ€™t have
any instructions more complex than "kill anyone not wearing robes."
