title: Dolmenwood Random Encounters

Dolmenwood has a great variety of random encounters, determined by whether it's
daytime or nighttime, by the party's travelling or camping situation, and by the
region of Dolmenwood they're in.  On top of that, all the new Dolmenwood
monsters have tables of suggested encounters, lairs, treasure hauls, and even
individual twists.  And on top of all *that*, intelligent monsters will have
names too.

That's potentially a lot of rolling and improvisation to do at the table for a
single encounter.  So when I was running my Dolmenwood campaign last year, I
found that I would often just pick the simplest options.  But that meant I was
missing out on potentially cool encounters.

To fix that, I pre-rolled a bunch of random encounters, came up with all those
little details, and then just picked the next one off the appropriate list in
sessions.

Here are those lists.  Some of them are more inspired than others, but even the
mundane ones are a starting point.

    I rolled all these up using the Patreon draft material, which is why it has
    book references to OSE.  I know the random encounter and treasure tables have
    changed a little with the Kickstarter material, and everything should be in
    the Dolmenwood books now.


## Generic Encounters

### Animal

1. **2 Insect Swarm (OSE)** which the party just stumble into.

2. **2 Bear, Black (OSE)** digging up some roots.  Prefers to warily watch the
    PCs and wander off if approached, than to attack.

3. **8 False Unicorn (DCB)** nibbling on the grass, two males keeping watch.

4. **16 Red Deer (DCB)** drinking from a stream, three males keeping watch.

5. **3 Swamp Sloth (DCB)** creeping through the tree-tops.  One loses its grasp
    and lands on the party.

6. **10 Yegril (DCB)** licking moss from a tree.

### Aquatic

1. **9 Boggin (DMB)** emerging from a pool to chase an escaping slave (**Normal
    Human--Lost Soul (DMB)**) (naked and clad only in disgusting pondweed).  The
    lead Boggin has a necklace of human bones, crawling with worms and
    tadpoles. All smell terrible.

    The pool connects to a [large underwater
    cavern](https://dysonlogos.blog/2021/06/10/heart-of-darkling-gibberling-lake/)
    with **3 Boggin (DMB)** and **4 Normal Human--Lost Soul(DMB)**.

    of raw fish) leading a grizzled hunter (**level 2 Hunter (DPB)**) and a
    young lad (**Normal Human--Lost Soul (DMB)**) (both charmed) to a nearby
    pool.  The hunter's catch (a bundle of furs and a brace of pheasants) lie
    carelessly discarded nearby.

    The woman is visibly annoyed by the arrival of others, doesn't have a fake
    name prepared, and tries to extract herself from the situation ASAP.

    *Victims:*

    - Theglid Dunwallow (hunter)
    - Breglor Dunwallow

5. An adventuring party.

6. **12 Madtom (DMB)** goggle-eyed, hypnotised by a **Wyrm--Pheglm** which is
    directing them to dig up a nearby standing stone that has a "vexatious
    aura". The stone is actually an old waystone erected by the Church which
    casts *Cure Light Wounds* once per journey on all who sleep beside it.

    Forgotten, nearby, is a wooden cage with a panicked human child (**Normal

    - Josprey

2. **14 Acolyte (OSE)** of the Order of St. Faxis, leading a chained young woman
    they claim to be a witch who is to be put to the question.  The woman is
    accused of using magical herbs to dull men's wits and lead them into
    temptation.  In reality, she is a victim of jealous wives and lying
    husbands, she knows nothing about witches or witchcraft.

    *Lead Acolyte:*

    - Elijio

    *Not-Witch:*

    - Beatrice Addercapper

3. **2 Drune--Cottager (DMB)** in battle with a **Noble--Knight (OSE)** and **5

    serve as their guards.  The nobles are from a much more settled and safe
    part of the kingdom, and dismiss all mention of danger in the woods as just

    - Lady Livia Maro

    *Head Servants:*

2. **6 Treant (OSE)** listening patiently to a **Drune--Cottager (DMB)** who is

    densely-written gibberish (a portion of Gheillough's true name).

    *Drune:*

    - Mirroddor Doome

3. **8 Treant (OSE)** engaged in a long debate over what to do about the
    Nag-Lord.  The discussion has been going on for some years now, and they
    have just about agreed that the Nag-Lord exists and is bad.

4. **15 Zombie (OSE)** in battle with a party of frost elves.  **3 Elf--Courtier
    (DMB)** (of The Cold Prince), accompanied by **4 Elf--Knight (DMB)** and **6
    Elf--Wanderer (DMB)** (as servitors).  The Courtiers watch lazily from their
    mounts as the Knights deal with the zombies.

    outside dispels it).  One snail is translucent, hard to see through the
    shimmering force-cube; but its trail can be seen.  The other has multiple
    rows of snapping teeth with a paralysing bite.

    (daytime) / seeping under the door of the cottage of **2 Moss Dwarf (DMB)**

2. **7 Bog Zombie (DMB)** fleeing from a solitary **Friar (DMB)**, who is stuck

    *Friar:*

    - Gertwinne

3. **9 Moss Dwarf (DMB)** feverishly digging up a standing stone which they
    believe is blighting the fungi in the region.  The stone is a shard of black
    ice jutting out of a stream and is muttering what sounds like an
    incantation: actually the true name of Gheillough, the stone being conjured
    by the dreaming god.  No matter how deep they dig, the stream freezes to
    keep the shard in place.

    *Dwarf Foreman:*

    - Loblow

4. **5 Brainconk (DMB)** hidden in the treetops, nearby the corpse of a rider

    itself, each round.

2. **25 Goatfolk--Crookhorn (DMB)** cavorting and prancing around to abominable
    trumpets and pipes in a freshly-burnt clearing.  In the centre of the
    clearing is a poorly-made wooden statue of a unicorn, smeared in blood and
    gore.  **8 Harpy (OSE)** are tormenting captured prisoners (**5 Normal
    Human--Lost Soul (DMB)**), occasionally killing one and bleeding them out

    cave-lair, which it decks with sculptures of mud, bone, and viscera.

    The party hear the screams of the latest victim, a scout of House
    Harrowmoor, but he is dead when they arrive.

    *Treasure:*

    - Goat-horn dagger (chaotic item)
    - 26sp
    - Holy +2 Disrupting flanged mace

6. **Ataunwe (DCB)**, at the centre of a mighty conflagration of chaotic
    magic. It sees the PCs and smiles before disappearing.  The surrounding area

    meat, purple grass, sun is blue and sky is yellow only within that area,
    etc.

    children---flitting in and out of the underwater doors and windows of a

    dialect (grandparent-like), who were on a pilgrimage from Castle Brackenwold
    to the Abbey of St Clewyd, and got lost.  They have no idea where they are,
