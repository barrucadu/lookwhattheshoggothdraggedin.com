title: My Arden Vul campaign, 6 months in
date: 2023-11-18

I've been running a campaign of [The Halls of Arden Vul][] for 6 months now.
It's been a lot of fun so far, and we have *barely* scratched the surface: we'll
be playing this for a long time yet.  I do not regret the expensive books at
all.

This post is for the potential Arden Vul [abbr:gm], still on the fence over
whether to run it or not.  I'll cover what it is and generally how I feel about
it now that I've got some experience with it (though this isn't a comprehensive
review); the highlights of my campaign and what crazy stuff the players have got
up to in the last 24 weekly sessions; and then the practical matters of what
rules I use (including my [house rules][]), what I prepared before starting the
campaign, and how I run it week to week; and finally I'll end with some assorted
advice.

If you're completely unfamiliar with Arden Vul, I *highly* recommend the [3d6
Down The Line actual play][].  They're now 50 sessions in and unlike many actual
plays they focus on playing the game as you would normally play it at home,
rather than being a performance to entertain the viewers.  Of course, there's
still some of that, but it is much more like a normal game than most.  It's what
put Arden Vul on my radar and ultimately convinced me to get it.

    This post has a lot of spoilers.  So if you're a player (including my players), turn back now.


## What is Arden Vul?

Arden Vul is a megadungeon---that is, a single dungeon large enough to be the
site for a whole campaign, supporting months or even years of play---there's an
appendix with information about the wider world too, but that's really just
providing context for the material in the dungeon.

I actually think the introduction from the book does an excellent job of selling
it, and is what I sent my players when I pitched Arden Vul to them:

> Who has not heard rumors of the lost city of Arden Vul?  During the glory days
> of the Archontean Empire, now 1,200 years in the past, Arden Vul was a small,
> but important, wealthy and secretive imperial center located atop a

> city attracted alchemists, scholars, priests and sorcerers by the droves.
> Seeking the lost secrets of long-dead civilizations as well as the mysterious

I described it to my players as a dungeon with *history*.  This is the first
megadungeon our group has played, so I really wanted to emphasise that this
isn't like what we've done before.  Arden Vul isn't an "adventure site."  You
can't "clear" Arden Vul.  It's a place to explore, full of ancient mysteries to
figure out, lost treasures to recover, and denizens to bargain with.

There's no overarching story.  Or, rather, the book presents several
possibilities for that.  But the default mode of play is completely
player-driven.

The setting is a kind of Ancient Egypt / Rome / Byzantine Empire mashup.  Not
exactly your standard fantasy setting, but close enough that it's not really a
problem.  There's also a strong sci-fi element, but that's hidden away from the
players initially.  Mine haven't stumbled upon it yet (but I want them to, so
much).

The material is *dense*.  Arden Vul may have nearly 2000 keyed rooms (and
countless unkeyed corridors), spread across 10 main dungeon levels and 13
sublevels, but it's not just a load of empty rooms and uninteresting spaces.
More often than not, rooms have something interesting in them, something to
steal, experiment with, or talk to.  Even the very construction style gives
clues to the dungeon's secrets, with different inhabitants building their rooms
at different times and in different ways, and later inhabitants repurposing them
but leaving the stonework intact.

Again, I highly recommend you check out the [3d6 Down The Line actual play][] if
you're not familiar with Arden Vul at all.


## Is it fun?

Emphatically, *yes*.  It is so much fun.

I've gushed to my players between sessions a few times about what I really love
about Arden Vul: everything is interconnected, and the interesting stuff isn't
gated behind being deep in the dungeon.

Firstly, connections.  There are passages and level connections *everywhere*.  A
couple of entrances to the dungeon are fairly well-known, but there are also
hidden ones which---if you can find them---will bring you really deep into the
dungeon really quickly.  Every dungeon level has passages to multiple other
levels, so once you're inside you can get around pretty quickly as well.  Some
passages are easier to find, and so fairly well known to the adventuring
community; others are less well known (or even totally unknown) and so knowing
where they are gives you some advantage, and possibly leads you to some
undiscovered treasure.  But that advantage comes with risk, because the less
well known (and less well-travelled) parts of the dungeon are more likely to
have unknown dangers!

Secondly, interesting stuff.  The *very first thing* you encounter in the ruined
city on the surface is the Obelisk of the Sun.  That, along with the Obelisks of
the Moon and Stars, lead to *the buried bridge of an ancient alien spaceship* if
you can solve the riddle and find the keys, which you can do entirely on the
surface without setting foot into the dungeon.  It's *easier* if you go deep
into the dungeon and find some useful lore and possibly some keys, but you *can
do it* without that.  And the whole dungeon is full of this sort of thing.
Secrets upon secrets that delving into the dungeon helps with, but isn't
required.  You can find something interesting in Arden Vul and just start
working away at it, unlike some dungeons where you can't really make progress
beyond a certain point without being high level.

I've read the books, so I know the whole truth.  But I can't predict how the
players will experience that truth, and listening to them try to puzzle things
out from the scraps of lore they've managed to uncover so far is really
enjoyable.

Looking back through my notes, this line near the beginning of the campaign
catches my eye:

> So far the players have been under the impression that Arden Vul is a dead
> place full of mostly unintelligent monsters.  But it's about to get weird.

This was just after they found a route down to the uppermost Troll Lift station
on level 5, and we ended the session with them *en route* to the Arena level.

That's another thing I like about Arden Vul: it's not *just* a dungeon.  There
are intelligent monsters, there are factions, there's a whole subterranean
society.  Exploring dusty old rooms and figuring out ancient mysteries is fun,
but being able to interact with people is fun too, and keeps things fresh.  The
current inhabitants are tied into the dungeon history, too, and learning about
one teaches you about the other.

However, it would be remiss of me to portray it as all sunshine and rainbows.
Running Arden Vul does have some challenges.

The main problem is that it's just not as well laid-out as some other [abbr:osr]
material, such as the [abbr:ose] books and adventures.  Descriptions tend to be
long and wordy, and the PDF isn't hyperlinked, which makes skimming through
things at the table a little tricky at times.  I did a lot of reading before
starting the campaign, and still sometimes have to call a short break while I
look something up.

I'll go into how I prep and run sessions more below.

It's not a module you can pick up and run with no prior work, unlike some
dungeons, but despite that I still *highly* recommend it.


## My campaign (so far)

We play weekly on Sundays for 3 hours and have had a couple of short breaks to
do one-shots of other systems.  Including session 0, we've played 24 sessions of
Arden Vul now.

The players have explored about half of level 1 (The Basement), a third of level
2 (The Howling Caves), a fifth of level 3 (The Halls of Thoth), and small
fragments of level 5 (The Obsidian Gates), level 6 (The Troll Lifts), sublevel 4
(The Goblin Warrens), and sublevel 15 (The Druid's Retreat).

They've met the Halflings, the Varumani (only in neutral spaces like the lifts),
and the Beastmen, seen at a distance the Goblins, and heard rumours of the
Heqeti (only as a historical foe), Kerbog Khan (or at least, one of his
automatons), and the Set Cult.

I try to get the players to be somewhat goal-oriented, but it never lasts for
more than a session or two.  So they have a *lot* of open threads, but broadly
their major priorities right now are:

- To explore level 2 while the baboons are still afraid of them.
- To get a full set of glass teleportation squares.
- To find the Obelisk of the Stars and get two more ankh-keys.

*My* priority is just to have them find cool stuff, as there is so much cool
stuff in this dungeon, and the point of a cool secret is *to be found*.

Meet the party:

- **Fern Thistlefoot**, Halfling 3, PC
- **Cinnabar**, Dwarf 4, PC
- **Ethelflad**, Acolyte 4, retainer
- **Periclase**, Dwarf 4, PC
- **Ari**, Fighter 3, retainer
- **Esme**, Thief 3, retainer
- **Tubcleaner**, Goblin 3, retainer
- **Tresti Iredell**, Magic-User 2, retainer

We've somehow not had any PC deaths yet, but we have had a few retire, and we've
had *many* retainer deaths.

- **Calsif**, Paladin 1, PC: retired due to the player leaving
- **Aesgeir**, Mage 1, retainer: the same
- **Agnar**, Thief 1, retainer: killed by chasm cephalopods on level 3
- **Chyde**, classless, retainer: killed by ghouls on level 3
- **Decima**, Thief 1, retainer: died with Chyde
- **Rodger**, Fighter 1, retainer: retired after a big payday
- **Shane**, Mage 3, PC: retired due to the player wanting a different class
- **Hilda**, Magic-User 1, retainer: killed by a wight on the surface
- **Nayan**, classless, retainer: died with Hilda

The players like to travel back to Gosterwick after every big haul to deposit
their loot in the bank, level up, and spend a few days resting.  They also
favour short delves.  So quite a lot of time has passed in our 24 sessions: the
campaign started on the 24th of Fidios (December), 2993 AEP and it's now the
11th of Lucrios (April), 2994 AEP.

I'm not going to give a complete blow-by-blow history of the campaign, but here
is a rough outline, along with a little of my thinking (where I can remember
it):

- **24-Fid-2993:** Our campaign begins with the PCs standing at the base of the
    Long Stair, next to the deafeningly loud waterfall, drenched in spray and
    looking up the 1500ft cliff.  They ascended, looked at a few things on the
    surface, and were guided to the Sign of the Broken Head by the watchmen.

    > I was afraid that we might have had a TPK in the first session, as they
    > almost crossed the bridge into the donjon, which is guarded by constructs.
    > I narrowly avoided that by having them hear the watchmen in the towers
    > yelling to get their attention.

- **25-Fid-2993:** The first delve.  The party figured out how to open the
    hidden door in the Pyramid of Thoth that leads down into the dungeon, and
    descended.

    > Manipulating the statue of Thoth in the wrong way can open a second door
    > that leads to a trap.  I decided that wasn't very fun, so I removed that.

    They met Roskelly and the rest of the halfling gang, grudgingly paid for an
    "adventuring licence," and found a secret stairway up (3-27).  On the way
    out, they wrote "Roskelly is a bitch" on the stairwell walls.

- **27-Fid-2993:** Our first use of the Death & Dismemberment house rules:
    Cinnabar got concussed by zombies and needed to spend several days resting.
    The other party members left her behind at the Sign of the Broken Head and
    continued exploring the surface, which felt safer than going into the
    depths, and found the Sodality of the Fist's secret entrance (AV-12).  The
    players were really keen to see if this brings them down into the dungeon
    without needing to pass the halfling checkpoint.

- **29-Fid-2993 to 12-Mol-2994:** The party sold a statue to some merchants at
    the Sign of the Broken Head.  Unfortunately, payment is upon delivery to the
    town of Newmarket.  So the PCs spent a few weeks lugging it down to
    Gosterwick and then transporting it via mule caravan to Newmarket.  5000gp
    never felt so sweet.

- **13-Mol-2994:** Ethelflad found a cool stone torch.  Unfortunately, it fused
    itself to his hand, and he couldn't give it up or let it down.  The party
    left the dungeon after sunset, and had their first run-in with
    Craastonistorex, a dragon living in the ruined city, who extorted half their
    treasure from them.

    > By some incredible fluke, every single random encounter I've rolled on the
    > surface has been with Craastonistorex!  I've altered all of them since, as
    > I don't want the players to feel like the dragon is stalking them...

- **14-Mol-2994:** The party don't want to risk messing around with curses, so
    they went to Gosterwick and made a large "donation" to one of the temples to
    regain the freedom of Ethelflad's hand.

    > There are no prices listed for clerical services in Gosterwick, so I took
    > the costs at The Sign of the Broken Head and halved them.  I also decided
    > the temples wouldn't blatantly put it in terms of selling divine magic,
    > even though that's what's happening.

- **15-Mol-2994:** They descended the staircase at AV-12, spotted a secret door
    in the room they arrived in (3-52A), opened that---revealing another
    staircase---and *continued down*...

    Now on the 5th floor, they met a troll who proclaimed himself to be "Riglon,
    Vice-Overseer of the Lifts, Appointed by the Thegn" and demanded their
    obeisance.  Riglon oversees a rickety basket contraption mounted to the side
    of the chasm, he says the party can ride it down if they pay a fee.  Of
    course they do.

    > The book says that the normal fee is 10sp per person, but that Riglon will
    > charge them 1gp.  In the session I didn't really pick up on how weird a
    > statement that is (since 10sp = 1gp), but I looked into it afterwards and
    > found that in [abbr:adnd], 1gp = 20sp.  So Riglon (and most of the other
    > lift operators) charge unsuspecting rubes twice the normal price.
    >
    > I decided to leave it, and also to not adjust any of the other prices in
    > the book.  Everything is cheaper, but treasure is also worth less, so it
    > probably works out fine except in the odd case, such as this.

    They arrived on a floating island, now about 1200ft down, and met another
    troll---Hakrim, Vice-Overseer of the Lifts---who told them that the arena
    and the inn are to the north-east, and some sort of Archontean shrine
    complex to the south-west.  The party went to the arena, arriving just as a
    fight began, and saw a crowd composed of all sorts of races: humans,
    goblins, trolls, and strange beast-headed men.  They also saw at a distance
    the Lord of the Arena: a tall bipedal humanoid with two little horns,
    wearing strange clothes; not a race they're familiar with.

    Pondering what this all means, that evidently a vibrant society dwells in
    the halls, the party retired to the inn and paid some exorbitant prices.

- **16-Mol-2994:** The party went to check out that Archontean shrine complex,
    and discovered a shrine dedicated to the famed archon, Marius Tricotor, who
    subjugated the trolls and conquered the halls!  Periclase spotted a secret
    door in the ceiling and improvised a rope contraption to get up there,
    discovering a passage north.

    The passage led, indirectly, to the lost tomb of Marius Tricotor (and to
    some undead guardians the players managed to sneak around), which the party
    looted with that innate knack for hidden treasure that players have, finding
    a lot of wealth, a *Vorpal Sword*, and a *Rod of Lordly Might*.

    > The *Rod of Lordly Might* is a bit of a game-changer as it can turn into a
    > flaming sword without consuming any charges.  So it has dramatically
    > changed the lighting situation.  While it's led to a lot of cool things, I

    > second light source is handy, as is being able to hide that you have a
    > flaming sword.
    >
    > In hindsight, I made it far too easy to sneak around the guardians.

- **18-Mol-2994 to 03-Deut-2994:** The party returned to Gosterwick, sold or
    banked all their treasure (transforming immediately from small-time
    customers of the Rarities Factor to some of its most significant), and all
    reached **level 2.**  They decided to stay for a while longer to squander
    some of their new-found wealth on philanthropic ventures, gaining additional
    XP, and all reaching **level 3.**

    In this time Agnar, the first thief, was hired.  It would not be for very
    long.

- **05-Deut-2994:** The party descended back into the dungeon and thoroughly
    explored the area around 3-52A.  They discovered the Great Seat of
    Contemplation, getting a glimpse of all the chasm-connected rooms on
    level 3.  They also noticed that the strange glyphs on the Seat look
    somewhat similar to (but more sophisticated than) some engravings on statues
    outside the arena, but it's not a language any of them recognise.

    > I'm pretty sure the players have since forgotten what they saw.

- **08-Deut-2994:** The party managed to string up a rope bridge across the
    chasm (by lobbing a grappling hook at the Lesser Seat of Contemplation), and
    explored beyond, hoping to join their level 3 map segments.

    Chasm cephalopods killed Agnar.  The rest of the party barely made it away
    alive.  Cinnabar got poisoned by giant centipedes on the way out and needed
    to spend a few days resting.

- **19-Deut-2994:** With everyone healed, and a new thief---Decima---in tow, the
    party returned to the dungeon.

    Decima picked a lock, the first successful use of thief skills in the
    campaign, and then promptly got killed (along with Chyde) by the ghouls on
    the other side of the door.  Everyone else narrowly escaped, again, unable
    to recover the bodies or equipment.

    While fleeing, the party encountered a friendly ghost, who couldn't speak
    but who pantomimes to them that he is unable to rest due to the ghouls which
    disrupted his burial.

- **27-Deut-2994:** Periclase found some weirdly well-preserved, and incredibly
    comfortable-looking, boots on the feet of a dwarven corpse.  He immediately
    put on the cursed footwear.  They also found a dwarven life-stone of the
    Malachite clan, and decide to send that back to Kazildor, city of the
    dwarves, when they can.

- **28-Deut-2994:** Armed with spears and tactics, the party made use of a
    chokepoint to thin out the ghouls, then advanced into the desecrated burial
    chamber of the Priors of Thoth to put down the remaining few and their wight
    leader.  They then put the bones of Jacobus, the ghost they met previously,
    into his tomb.  Jacobus appeared, thanked them, and indicated a secret
    compartment full of more treasure than could be carried out in one trip.

    On their way out the party were discovered and chased by a patrol of
    beastmen, who warned the party away from this area of the halls and cut down
    the rope bridge.

    > The players also lied to the beastmen patrol, saying that the halflings
    > sent them this way.  I totally forgot about that, so nothing came of it.

- **29-Deut-2994 to 10-Tot-2994:** Defying the beastmen, the party retrieved all
    the loot (with a couple of trips), spent a while getting this (and previous)
    loot identified, Periclase has his cursed boots removed, and Cinnabar
    arranges for some dwarven adventurers to take the life-stone the party found
    back to Kazildor.

    One of the magic items they found was a *Belt of Giant Strength*.  Periclase
    decides to wear it, and the player rolls the best possible stats: +6 to hit,
    +12 damage.  Periclase also has the *Rod of Lordly Might*, but is only level
    4 at this point, so is a bit of a glass cannon.

- **11-Tot-2994:** The party spend the day reading a book they retrieved, *The
    Book of Priors*, which details numerous obvious and hidden stairwells in the
    halls which the party wasn't previously aware of.

    > I spent some time before this session thinking about what stairwells the
    > book might describe, and how it would describe them.  I came up with this
    > list of clues:
    >
    > - south of the entrance to the catacombs, west of the Hall of Judges,
    >   north of the Glory of Thoth beneath the pyramid
    >
    > - due east from Thoth the Knower of Secrets at the north end of the chasm
    >
    > - near there, beyond a hidden door in the southern wall of the Room of the
    >   Ibis Guardians
    >
    > - beyond a secret door east of the Greater Hall of Columns, where the
    >   corridor turns north to the Lesser Seat of Contemplation
    >
    > - west of our glorious Temple of Thoth lies the Temple of Set, and west of
    >   that are stairs down to the Halls of Set
    >
    > - the residence of the Overseer of Truth is up the great spiral staircase
    >   to the south-west of the Great Hall
    >
    > - north of the bridge across the chasm on the level of the Obsidian Gates,
    >   there is a stair down warded by statues of legendary heroes
    >
    > - north-east of the Tomb of Marius Tricotor, a stair down to the
    >   administrative complex
    >
    > - at the northern end of the administrative complex, a spiral stair down
    >   to the clerical offices near the Court of the Troll Thegn
    >
    > - the clerical offices north-west of the Court of the Troll Thegn have a
    >   passage to Marius' outpost at the floor of the chasm

- **12-Tot-2994:** Following directions from the book, the party found a secret
    stairwell choked with cobwebs.  Unfortunately, they're driven back by
    spiders---but throw a flaming torch into the webs as they flee.

    > They've not gone back here yet.  Another unresolved thread...

- **13-Tot-2994:** The party went up the secret staircase they found way back in
    their first delve (3-27) and discovered level 1 of the dungeon.  They met
    Lankios, refused his disgusting soup, and found the exit to the surface.
    But rather than leaving, they went back down to level 3 and out through the
    Pyramid of Thoth, to avoid tipping the halflings off that there's another
    way out.

    There was much rejoicing over finding an entrance to level 3 not inside the
    territory of another faction.

- **14-Tot-2994:** The party decided to search the surface some more, and found
    the stairwell down to the goblin warrens (AV-16).  Listening at the Lesser
    Obsidian Gates and hearing *many* goblins, the party decided to not open
    them.  But they make note of how deep they are and start thinking about how
    they might find the other side of those doors (and whatever goblin town is
    there) from inside the dungeon.

- **19-Tot-2994:** The party visited the House of the Thesmothete to incorporate
    as a legal entity, *A Short Adventure*, so they can own property in
    Gosterwick jointly.  They also bought some land and arranged for the
    construction of a small house.

    > I wasn't sure how much to charge them for land, so I somewhat arbitrarily
    > settled on 10gp per 5ft square (half that for citizens), with a 5% annual
    > property tax.  I looked through a lot of blogs and books, and was
    > surprised that I couldn't find anything more official for buying land in a
    > settlement.

- **22-Tot-2994:** The party decoded another clue from the *Book of Priors* and
    found the route up from the catacombs of level 3 to level 2.  They then
    break into Isocritis's lab, destroy his animated statue, and abscond with
    his treasure.  On the way out they fight Sisko and a bunch of baboons,
    nearly killing Sisko in the process.

    > I decided that once Gerrilad learned of this, he'd go fully paranoid,
    > assume another dungeon faction had hired the PCs to steal something, and
    > start preparing an ambush for if they returned.

- **28-Tot-2994:** The party met with the Thesmothete about building a free
    hospital in Gosterwick.  They fully funded its construction and one year of
    operating costs up front.

    > I introduced the "institution" rules from [Downtime in Zyan][] for this.
    > The players had been talking about setting up a temple or a hospital or
    > something for a while, and I wanted it to be an ongoing thing, not just
    > something they pay money for and never interact with again.

- **30-Tot-2994:** The party tried plugging a large silver ankh they found in
    Isocritis's lab into the Obelisk of the Sun at noon.  Nothing happened, but
    it fits so well...

    They searched the surface some more, and found the Obelisk of the Moon.  The
    players immediately jumped to the conclusion that there must also be an
    Obelisk of the Stars, and started pouring over their map to try to work out
    where that could be.

    "We're gonna need more ankhs" -- one player

    They then entered the Long House, and we nearly had a TPK.  A *Potion of
    Control Undead (Ghouls)* that they previously found saved the day, though
    Hilda and Nayan are killed, and Esme gets level-drained.

- **03-Luc-2994:** The party returned to level 2, to be ambushed by the baboons
    Gerrilad left waiting for them.  They managed to escape into a room and
    spike it shut, but the baboons start to break the door down.

    > We ended the session on that cliffhanger.  I worked out a timeline for how
    > long it'd take one baboon to alert Sisko and Trefko, who'd go alert
    > Gerrilad, and then gather some reinforcements.  I decided that Gerrilad
    > would wait in 2-35 and call for Isocritis (then in the library), whereas
    > Sisko and Trefko would try to capture the PCs (maybe killing some) and
    > bring them to Gerrilad.

    The party took up defensive positions, doused the floor in front of the door
    with *Oil of Slipperiness*, and waited for the door to burst open.  They
    then managed to drive off the baboons, though Sisko and Trefko fled when
    they saw their minions being cut down.

    They then cautiously explored the floor, and found Gerrilad in the middle of
    torturing Gwelf for information, as he'd assumed that the dwarf PCs were
    connected to Gwelf.  Periclase assumed Gerrilad must be some sort of
    spellcaster, and used a *Potion of Flying*, a *Ring of Friendly Defense* (to
    turn invisible), and his *Rod of Lordly Might* (in axe form) to sneak up to
    Gerrilad and behead him.

    I was so proud.

    The players then freed the prisoners and Jost led them out through the
    secret passage just north of 2-35 (leading ultimately to the stairwell in
    2-46).

- **04-Luc-2994:** The party returned to Gosterwick to deal with some treasure,
    buy a mule, and arrange for Creon (of Creon's Curios, the pawn shop) to keep
    an eye out for any little glass teleportation squares.

- **10-Luc-2994:** The party returned to level 2, with Tresti to seek out
    Isocritis and retrieve her spellbook.  They found signs of some sort of
    clash near the library: a row of baboon heads and spiked-shut doors marking
    off a section of the level.  There was also a note on the library door, to
    "the adventurers," from Isocritis, saying he was willing to negotiate---just
    knock, step back 20ft, and do *not* call out.

    After a lengthy discussion, the players decided to give it a try, and found
    Isocritis surprisingly agreeable: he was willing to give up Tresti's
    spellbook, all he wanted was for himself and this little part of level 2 to
    be left alone.

## Rules

We use the [abbr:ose] Advanced Fantasy rules.  Arden Vul is written for
[abbr:adnd], so I also reference [abbr:osric] for [abbr:adnd]-specific material.
Fortunately, [OSRIC is free][].  The main things to convert are:

- **Alignment:** [abbr:bxdnd] uses one-axis alignment, [abbr:adnd] uses two-axis.

    My general approach is to treat Good and Evil as personality traits, not as
    alignments.  To say someone is "Good" or "Evil" is just a descriptor of how
    they tend to act, nothing more.  Whereas Law and Chaos are more connected to
    your religious beliefs and which gods religious characters are pledged to.
    I handle magical effects which key off alignment on a case-by-case basis.

- **Monsters:** Where monsters have an [abbr:ose] version, I use that; otherwise
    I use the Arden Vul version without further conversion.

    As [abbr:adnd] is a bit higher-powered, this means the [abbr:adnd] monsters
    are a bit stronger and more resilient than the [abbr:ose] ones.  But that's
    not really been an issue so far.  The players just have to be cautious.

- **Magic Items and Spells:** A lot of these aren't in the [abbr:ose] Referee's
    Tome.

    Unfortunately, [abbr:adnd] spells don't quite map cleanly to [abbr:ose],
    because in [abbr:adnd] one combat round is 60s, and what [abbr:bxdnd] calls a
    "round", [abbr:adnd] calls a "segment".  I don't like specifying spell
    durations in "minutes", since nothing else in the game uses that, so when I
    copy a spell over from [abbr:osric] I pick a new duration for it.

I mostly convert things on the fly, I don't tend to read ahead and pre-convert
things.  This does mean that things might change between sessions, but I'm open
with the players about it, and it's fine.  I told them going in that we're
playing a different system to the one the material is written for, so I would be
converting it on the fly and might make mistakes.

My collection of [House Rules][] is pretty standard, I think.  No major
surprises there.

It's not a complete document in itself: I'm incorporating some material from the
[Carcass Crawler zines][] and from [Downtime in Zyan][].  I do toy with the idea
of writing and printing a complete book that's the subset of the [abbr:ose] rules
we're actually using, plus all the house rules; but then I wouldn't be able to
distribute that, and also I change the house rules on occasion so it'd get out
of date.

Maybe something for the future, I could celebrate one year of Arden Vul (in
another 6 months) by giving myself and all the players a custom rulebook.
That'd be fun.

The house rules have been fairly static from the beginning, just with minor
tweaks, other than three significant changes during the course of the campaign:

- **Carousing:** Everyone knows carousing rules.  Who doesn't love a carousing
    mishaps table?

    We found we just didn't really use it.  The philanthropy rules come up just
    about every time the party return to Gosterwick, but I think we only ever
    went carousing once.  The players just didn't make the sort of characters
    who go on wild parties, accidentally burn down taverns, and wake up in the
    town gaol up to their eyeballs in debt.  We had a discussion about what sort
    of fantasy carousing rules model, decided that wasn't the game we were
    playing, and removed them.

- **Training:** [abbr:adnd] requires you to undertake training to level up, and
    there are trainer NPCs in Gosterwick.  So when we started the campaign, we
    decided to use training rules.

    We ended up removing it because it was just adding a time and money cost to
    levelling, and wasn't in practice encouraging the sort of gameplay I wanted
    it to: which was building relationships with these powerful local NPCs.
    That just... didn't happen.  My fault for not pushing it more, but there's
    enough fun stuff going on already without needing to make those specific
    NPCs super relevant to the campaign.

- **Philanthropy:** We started with a fairly simple "donate some gp, receive 80%
    as XP" rule.

    But once the players came into a lot of wealth after looting Marius
    Tricotor's tomb, they started talking about maybe building a temple to
    Adenia Tesseron, who doesn't have her own temple in Gosterwick, or maybe
    building a free hospital.  That's awesome and I want to encourage that sort
    of thing, but I also wanted to encourage an ongoing interaction with any
    organisation they establish.

    So we decided to pull in the institution rules from [Downtime in Zyan][].

    While I was at it, I also added an incentive to donate to a specific cause
    (and so interact with powerful NPCs) rather than just being generally
    philanthropic.  And it's working great!  The players have set up a free
    hospital and one of them visits it to check up on things every time they're
    in town.

I do want to mention, though, that we've just not found the Mage class fun, and
it might get axed from the next version of the house rules.  Your experience may
vary, but the Mage player said after 3 months that they weren't enjoying the
class, had never enjoyed the class, should have said something earlier, and
wanted to retire their character.

Not noticing that was a bit of a miss on my part.

## Running the Halls

### Tools we use

Normally I use [Foundry][] for my RPG campaigns.  But I decided not to for Arden
Vul for two reasons:

- **Character Sheets:** I knew I wanted to make some changes to the core rules,
    like using item-based encumbrance.  So I'd need to change the character
    sheets.  Foundry character sheets are defined in code, and while I am a
    software engineer by trade and do program things for fun, I didn't really
    feel like reprogramming my [abbr:vtt] just to run a game.

    I already went down that route previously, with [Roll20][], and it led to a
    lot of work.

- **Mapping:** The Foundry drawing tools are pretty bad.  The assumption is very
    much that the [abbr:gm] provides cool maps with dynamic lighting and effects
    and everything all set up, and the players just move their tokens through
    the map.  The drawing tools are for quickly sketching something small.

    But for Arden Vul, I wanted the players to do the mapping.  I looked at a
    few Foundry modules, but none of them really fixed the issues to my
    satisfaction.

Now, after 6 months, our tech stack is:

- [Discord][] for voice chat during sessions, and text chat between sessions.  I
    also put up an event for each session so people can indicate whether they'll
    be present or not.
- [Dice Maiden][] (a Discord bot) for dice rolling.
- [Miro][] for mapping (we started with [Owlbear Rodeo][] but it started to lag
    with the size of the maps).
- Google Docs for character sheets and player notes.
- For my own note-taking I use [Obsidian][], more on that below.

Miro isn't an RPG-specific tool, it's boring business software which I actually
use at work.  But it occasionally shows up in RPG circles because it's just a
very capable virtual whiteboard.  3d6 Down The Line [did a video on using Miro
for mapping][] that may be of use.

It performs well enough that we can use a single board for all of Arden Vul,
which is great, because you can indicate level connections and can easily
compare the layouts of different levels and work out how things are related.

See the appendix to this post for some examples of our map.

I've also made [a blank character sheet available][], which you can use as the
start of your own.  It has some automation, like filling in saving throws based
on class, and computing your movement speed.  It only has the classes we use in
our campaign though.

### Preparing for the campaign

I didn't intend to start Arden Vul this year.  I was planning to run a Delta
Green campaign and then do Arden Vul some time after that, in 2024, but due to
scheduling issues I couldn't actually get a group together for Delta Green.  I
realised I needed a game that would be tolerant of players dropping in and out.
Something without a big overarching linear story which you *need* to be aware of
to meaningfully contribute.

So I picked Arden Vul.

Unfortunately, this gave me two weeks to prepare a *huge* campaign I'd intended
to spend the best part of a year leisurely reading through.  But I managed it,
and so can you.

Firstly, the main thing I credit for my success was the [3d6 Down The Line
actual play][].  This was back in May, they were 27 episodes in, and had done
some significant exploration of levels 2 and 3.  I felt pretty comfortable with
the overarching themes of at least the upper levels of the dungeon, and I
expected my players to spend a lot of time on level 3 (I was wrong), giving me
time to read ahead in the 1200-page 5 book set that is Arden Vul.

Beyond that, I focussed on volume 1, cross-referencing it with volume 4:

- **General Introduction:** This is gold, I carefully read all of this, and used
    the appendices to add context.

- **Exterior Adventure Locations:** I read all of this, I could have maybe
    skipped some of it but it's not that long.  I read the sections on
    Gosterwick and The Sign of the Broken Head multiple times, as I wanted those
    really clear in my head as the players will interact with them a lot.

- **The Halls of Arden Vul:** I read the introduction to levels 1, 2, 3, and 4
    (all the ones in volume 1) to get a rough sense for what's going on and what
    the layout is, and also read the descriptions of the rooms in those levels
    close to exterior exits.  I skimmed through the rest, stopping and reading a
    little more closely when an interesting room name or especially long
    description caught my eye.

I also decided to make a small change to the dungeon at this point.  The Pyramid
of Thoth has a trap entrance (UP-6).  I decided to just remove that, as I
thought the party potentially all being killed the very first time they try to
head into the dungeon wouldn't be very fun.

After that, I felt like I had a good enough idea that I'd be able to run at
least a few sessions.  Of course, I'd be looking up room descriptions during
play, but that's fine, the overarching knowledge helps with quickly parsing
those.

I also noted down overland travel times for places I expected them to move
between frequently (like Gosterwick and The Sign of the Broken Head), the
Archontean calendar, and the weather tables from Dolmenwood.  See the appendix
to this post for those.  The travel times in particular are really useful and
I've been adding to those as the campaign has gone on.

I then prepared for our session 0:

- I shared the first two paragraphs of the general introduction with the
    players.
- I wrote a first draft of the [House Rules][].
- I set up all the digital tools we'd need.
- I came up with a list of things to talk about (see the appendix to this post).

And then, feeling somewhat unprepared but generally hopeful, we began.  Could I
have done more?  Sure.  But don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

### Preparing for a session

There are two sorts of prep (I think):

- Reviewing material I think the players will encounter.
- Changing the dungeon based on the players' actions.

Depending on what's going on in the campaign, sometimes I need to do both,
sometimes just one.

The first is *just* reading.  If I think there's a good chance of the players
encountering something wildly different that would result in a lot of reading at
the table---meeting a faction we've not seen before (or not seen in a while),
visiting a new floor, engaging with some of the more complicated rooms,
etc---I'll review that material beforehand.

I kind of play this by ear.  In practice my players don't actually encounter
brand new stuff that pre-reading benefits very frequently, as they tend to
inefficiently bounce between a few different objectives for several sessions
(because they're *not goal-oriented*).  But on the other hand, Arden Vul is
massive, so even reading material which the players aren't likely to see for a
while is helpful, and makes reviewing it in the future (when it is likely to be
relevant) quicker.  So I've now read, or at least skimmed, all of the main
dungeon levels and some of the sublevels.

The second is a bit more involved.  Things the players do have knock-on effects:
for example, I decided that them killing Gerrilad would lead to the baboons
rising up against Isocritis, fighting to a stalemate where the baboons fear
Isocritis and would attack him if they had the chance, but where they don't
encroach upon his territory around the library area.

So far I don't have any specific tools for this beyond just staring at my notes
and thinking.  I try to get the dungeon back to a stable state fairly quickly.
I've not felt the need to pull in any faction mechanics or similar *yet*.  But
that's only because my players haven't really got into the faction game yet;
when they do, no doubt I'll want factions to start moving and shaking things
behind the scenes, and for the players to see the effects of that.  I'm not sure
what rules I will use, but I can figure that out later.

All that said, I know you all like procedures, so as far as I have a concrete
"prep procedure," here it is:

1. Review previous session notes.
2. Do any work left over from last time (e.g., converting spells or magic items
     from [abbr:osric] and copying them into the player notes).
3. Read any important material I think is likely to come up, or which just seems
     fun to read.
4. Think hard about the current state of the dungeon and whether the last
     session should result in any changes, and then note those down.

My prep is fairly light.  I expect it to get more complex over time, as the
players inevitably get more involved with the major dungeon factions and the big
secrets, but a pretty light touch gets you months of fun.

### Running a session

I thought I'd start this section with a screenshot of my set-up:

![My set-up for Arden Vul (with details obscured).](post/arden-vul-6-months-in/session-screenshot.png)

That's right, *three* monitors.  Two monitors are clearly better than one, and
you know what's even better than two?  Anyway, here's what I have open:

- Firefox window with Miro, character sheets, player notes, etc (monitor 1)
- Firefox window with a private dice roller and the donjon calendar (monitor 1)
- Obsidian with my notes, minimised (monitor 1)
- At least three copies of the main Arden Vul PDF (monitor 2)
- [Dungeon time tracker][] (monitor 2)
- Arden Vul maps PDF and all the rules PDFs (monitor 3)
- Discord (monitor 3)

Let's go through some of those choices:

- I just use Google's dice roller for my private rolls.  Yeah, it's basic, but
    it does the job, and I only use it for the occasional thing, e.g. for random
    encounters.

- Obsidian is minimised because my notes tend to be pretty brief.  I'll refer to
    them at the start of the session, and occasionally throughout the session,
    but I don't need them up all the time.

- Two copies of Arden Vul is really the minimum.  One open on the current room
    description, one to use to reference other things.  I like to have three in
    case I need to look up multiple things at once.

- I have all the maps and rules in the same PDF reader because I figure if I'm
    actively consulting rules I'm probably not also using the map, whereas if
    I'm consulting room descriptions I probably am also looking at the map at
    the same time.

Obviously it'd be even better if I could have more of that displayed at once.
Do I need a fourth monitor?  Perhaps a second, smaller, landscape one mounted
above the current one?  Is that too much?

You probably don't have three monitors, in which case you'll need to either
remedy that, or figure out what's most important for *you* to be able to see all
the time, and what can be relegated to the background.

On my desk I have:

- The [abbr:ose] referee screen, in case I need to reference anything there.
- The physical Arden Vul books, open to the random encounter table for the
  current floor.
- A pad of paper and a pen, to jot down rough notes as we play.
- A pot of delicious tea, to keep my throat nice and lubricated.

The actual running of the session is basically the same as any other game:

- I ask a player to give a recap of the previous session (I might fill in
  important details they miss).
- I summarise the current state: the date and time, where the party is, what the
  current situation is, anything of immediate importance.
- Then we begin: the players say what they do, I describe what happens, time
  advances, repeat.

After the session I distil my notes into what's actually important (monster HP
tracked in a battle, probably not important; a location partially looted, or an
important NPC interacted with, probably important) and type it up into Obsidian,
along with a list of things I need to do before next time (like adding any
non-[abbr:ose] spells they've found to the notes doc, or figuring out how an NPC
will react to the events of the session).  See the appendix to this post for an
example.

So, no real Arden Vul-specific advice here.  I guess that's good, you don't need
to do anything different to how you usually run your games.

[Dungeon time tracker]: https://necroticgnome.com/products/old-school-essentials-dungeon-time-tracker


## Parting words...

Here's some final advice that didn't really fit elsewhere but which I think is
important to share:

- **The point of a secret is *to be found*.**

    This is my number #1 guiding principle for running Arden Vul.  There is so,
    so, much cool stuff in this dungeon.  Most of it is hidden, beneath layers
    of history the players need to untangle, or physically behind secret doors.
    But it may as well not exist at all if it never sees play.

    Practically speaking, I won't make inferences for the players, but I will
    remind them to check their notes---or ask probing questions---if I think
    they're forgetting something or missing some connection.  I won't give them
    any information they haven't earned, but I remind them to follow up on
    threads they've left unfinished.

- **Reward clever problem solving.**

    This is my number #2 guiding principle.  Or maybe a joint #1, as it's also
    essential.  Mostly, this comes down to letting the players just succeed at
    something if they have a plan which I think will work, or at least improving
    their chances if a roll is still involved.

    If a player comes up with a way to sneak up to the evil wizard undetected
    and stab them in the neck, good job, they insta-kill the evil wizard.  I
    don't "lose" by having "my" NPC die ingloriously.  Similarly, if they come
    up with a way to circumvent a trap and there's no reason it wouldn't work,
    great, I want to see more of that sort of thing!

    Nothing kills creative thinking faster than feeling like it doesn't matter.

- **Don't overprepare.**

    In every discussion of Arden Vul, you see people saying how daunting it is,
    the tremendous amount of prep required.  And you certainly *can* prepare a
    lot.  But I hope my example shows that you don't actually need to read every
    room description, or convert every statblock, highlighting keywords and
    hyperlinking references, before you can even start.

    More prep can help, but the amount of *required* prep isn't monumental.  If
    preparing is fun and brings you peace of mind, go for it!  Otherwise just do
    the bare minimum to start playing, your players will understand if you
    occasionally need to take a minute to read a long description or look up a
    reference.

- **Embace [abbr:osr] principles.**

    The [Principia Apocrypha][] is a wealth of pithy advice for how to run this
    style of game.  I periodically return to it and I never feel like the reread
    is a waste of time.  Arden Vul is a megadungeon campaign setting written
    firmly in the old-school style.  Embrace that.

There's probably something I'm forgetting, more I could say, but in the spirit
of not overpreparing: **stop reading blog posts about Arden Vul and *start that
game!***

### Miro

Here's the overall Miro board.  The red dotted lines are level connections:

![A very zoomed-out look at our Miro board.](post/arden-vul-6-months-in/miro-full.jpg)

Here's a closer look at the roughly one-fifth of the Halls of Thoth that the
party have explored:

![The Halls of Thoth.](post/arden-vul-6-months-in/miro-level3.jpg)

The Miro export doesn't show it, but there is a grid there.  We're mapping at
5ft scale, as even though the Arden Vul map is at 10ft scale there are plenty of
things offset by half a square or which are half a square big.

### Session 0

These were my notes going into session 0.  Before this I'd already pitched the
idea of a megadungeon using some sort of [abbr:osr] system to the players, so
they were on board with the basic idea.

### Session notes

These are my notes for session 23 (with some player names excised), which the
party began in 2-35 (Gerrilad's throne room) about a week after they killed him.

This room has a big pile of coins, the way I handled that in the session was for
the players to just carry out "unsorted coins," and I wrote a little Python
program to work out what they actually took afterwards.  Alternatively, the
players could have sorted the coins, and so they could have chosen what to take,
but that would have taken in-game time and they didn't want to do that.

    out = {k: 0 for k in coins.keys()}

    for _ in range(retrieved):
        choices = list(coins.keys())
        weights = [coins[k] for k in choices]
        choice  = random.choices(choices, weights=weights)[0]
        out[choice]   += 1
        coins[choice] -= 1
