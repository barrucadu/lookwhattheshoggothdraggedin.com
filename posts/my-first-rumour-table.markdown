    Rumour tables are a staple of [glo:sandbox "sandbox"] style play,
    and I wanted to make one for my new [glo:traveller] campaign.  I
    found it pretty tricky to come up with a list of 20 interesting
    bits of lore and story hooks from nothing, but I managed it in the
    end.

I've recently started a new [glo:traveller] campaign.  I'll probably
write a post about how I prepared for it and how it's going after a
few more sessions, as we're only two sessions in so far (plus a
session zero).

It's a [glo:sandbox "sandbox"] style campaign: there is no overarching
story, no big bad the players must defeat, just a wide open universe
(and the [glo:traveller] universe is [very big indeed][]) for them to
explore and have adventures in.  But I couldn't just drop the
[glos:pc] in a starport and say "alright, you've got your first
spaceship---what do you do?"  They wouldn't have known what to do
because they wouldn't have known what they *could* do.

So I decided I needed, amongst other things, a rumour table.

## Rumour tables

The rumour table is a staple of old-school adventures.  Basically,
it's a list (usually of 20, or 12, or 10; some standard die size) of
adventure seeds, which the [glos:pc] can find by interacting with
[glos:npc].

You can write a rumour as just some keywords to use as a prompt for
improvisation, like:

> Goblin Caves, Evil Rituals, Missing Children

Or as something to read out to the players directly, like:

> There have been a dozen kidnappings over the last couple of months,
> with children being snatched out of their bedrooms by moonlight, and
> the villagers are scared to go out after dark.  After a child
> disappears, without fail, there are strange lights seen and evil
> chanting heard coming from the goblin caves.

A rumour table can be as general or as specific as you like.  If the
players are new to an area, you might make the table very generic and
have a little bit of everything, but not to any great detail.  But if
the players are looking into something in particular, you might have a
selection of detailed rumours about that thing.

## Preparing the table

Making a list of 20 interesting things is pretty hard.  For my first
session I could only come up with seven, of which the players found
four, and also fifth one which I made up on the spot by rolling on
some random tables.

Before the second session, I fleshed out the table to a full 20
entries.  That took several hours over a few days, but thankfully
it'll be much easier going forwards as I'll only need to come up with
a few new ones at a time, to replace rumours the players have found or
that I've decided are no longer interesting.

Since my players read this blog I won't share the current table here,
and the examples I give will be rumours they've already found.

Firstly, I decided that I liked the idea of them finding some totally
random things I'd not prepared in advance.  Using random tables for
patrons, missions, and encounters seems a very traditional approach to
running [glo:traveller], and I wanted to keep some aspect of that.  So
the first five entries on my table are all random:

!!!roll-table
Result
1,No rumour, roll a random encounter!
2,Job: roll a random Patron & Mission.
3,Job: roll a random Patron & Mission.
4,Roll a random encounter for the current location: the Traveller learns about this.
5,Roll a random space encounter for this or a nearby system: the Traveller learns about this.

The first three entries of my rumour table aren't actually rumours.
But that's ok.  If they're out gathering rumours, there *should* be a
chance that something else happens and they get caught up in it, or
that they skip the rumour step entirely and go straight to finding a
job.

The next two entries will, I hope, be a good source of improvised
adventures.  Maybe the player will roll a 4, and then I'll roll a 54,
for "Unusual Creature", on the Rural Encounters table of the Core
Rulebook---and the players will get a wild tale about carnivorous
starfish eating a man's leg.  Or they'll roll a 5, and then I'll roll
a 14 for "Comet" on the Space Encounters table of the Core
Rulebook---and the players will find themselves talking to a scientist
who thinks there are rare and valuable ores in there, if only you
could catch up to it.

The other 15 entries are a mixture of:

- **Jobs:** jobs I have prepared, rather than randomly generated ones.
  They found one of these in the first session:

    > A noble son in his yacht went missing on the way to Vume,
    > Cr100,000 reward for information, Cr200,000 for finding and
    > returning it.  **[imperium, job]**

- **Hooks:** rumours which lead to an adventure or job that I have in
  mind, if the players can follow up on it appropriately.  They found
  a few of these, for example:

    > The royal house of the Sindalian Empire never went extinct.  The
    > current Emperor of Sindal and Protector of the Reach still lives
    > on the old capital world of Noricum and gives the Imperial
    > Blessing of the Star Dragon to all who perform a service for
    > him.  **[sindal]**

- **Lore:** rumours which just give background information about the
  setting.  Lore doesn't directly lead to an adventure because it's
  too big in scope; but if the players decide that it interests them,
  I'll prepare jobs or hooks as appropriate.  For example:

    > The Hierate has taken the Glorious Empire worlds of Keawoaw and
    > Alr.  **[aslan, politics]**

- **Automatic Rumours:** these are rumours which the players will find
  by just meeting some condition I've determined, without needing to
  make a roll or specifically look for rumours.  They don't have any
  of these yet.

I don't tell the players what sort of rumour they've found, though a
job offer is kind of obvious.  But they can't necessarily tell if
something is an adventure hook or if it's just background lore until
they go investigate it.

Each rumour has a few tags, shown in bold above.  I use these to help
me decide what to give out to the players.  For example, if they say
they're looking for rumours specifically about Sindal, the Star
Dragon, Noricum, and so on, I'll bias the random choice towards other
rumours tagged **[sindal]**; or if they're gathering rumours at a
high-society party, they'll be more likely to find rumours tagged
**[politics]**.

## The table in play

The primary way for players to find rumours is to treat "rumour
gathering" as an activity in itself.

They might do this by spending the night in a bar socialising with the
patrons, or talking to starport dockworkers about traffic they've seen
coming through lately, or going to a party, or whatever else they can
imagine.  I'll call for an appropriate skill check and, on a pass,
give out one or two new random rumours.  On a fail they didn't learn
anything new.

Rumour gathering isn't really a passive thing, the players generally
won't just overhear rumours while doing something else (unless the
it's one of my automatic rumours and they meet the condition).

Some examples of rumour gathering checks could be:

- Attending a party: Average SOC / Carouse check, [glo:dice-notation "`1d6`"] hours
- Going on a pub crawl: Routine END / Carouse check, [glo:dice-notation "`4×1d6`"] hours
- Impressing people at a casino: Average INT / Gambler check, [glo:dice-notation "`1d6`"] hours

I don't have a very well-developed system here yet, but I'm *thinking*
that the base time for gathering rumours should be [glo:dice-notation
"`1d6`"] hours, as you've got to find some people and spend a while
talking to them.  Going faster or slower (like spending somewhere
between a night and a day going on a long pub crawl) will adjust the
difficulty up or down, according to the standard rules on timeframes
I've written about in [my previous post on Traveller dice rolls][].

Skills in [glo:traveller] are pretty flexible.  Gathering rumours
doesn't have to be done with an explicitly social skill, impressing or
blending in with any group of people could be done with a relevant
skill.  For example, a player could make an EDU / Gun Combat
check---which is a pretty unusual combination if you only think of Gun
Combat as skill for fighting with---to show off their knowledge to a
bunch of gun nuts and befriend them.

### Between sessions

At the end of a session, I look through my notes and:

1. Move any rumours the players have found (whether those be planned
   ones from the list or random ones I rolled up) to a separate list,
   so I can keep track of what information I've given them.

2. Delete any rumours which are no longer relevant or interesting
   enough to keep around.

3. Come up with new rumours, based on what the party are doing and
   what they're interested in, and what new things *I'm* interested
   in, to fill in any gaps.

This is a [glo:sandbox "sandbox"] game, but there are still things *I*
want to see in the campaign, and I like that I can use rumours to
introduce those topics.  But it's up to the players whether to follow
up on them or not.
