Troika is British science-fantasy roleplaying game, with a [free
SRD][], usually lumped in the [abbr:osr] sphere even though it's
descended from [Fighting Fantasy][] and not [abbr:dnd].

It's weird, fun, and pretty rules-light.

The implied setting is more of a super-far-future blend of sci-fi and
magic like *The Book of the New Sun* and *Dying Earth*, with hints of
*Discworld*, than it is *Lord of the Rings*.  This isn't your typical
fantasy roleplaying.

The book itself is physically really nice.  Good thick paper, light
coloured backgrounds with tables having a plain white background (so
they really stand out), art in a weird but fitting style, and it's a
hardback despite being short.

It just looks and feels very nice.

## The System

The core of the system is nice and straightforward.  It's an
attributes-and-skills system, but only has a few attributes.  There
are two slightly different core resolution mechanics, one for opposed
situations and one for unopposed, where you roll
`2d6` and compare it with your stats.

There are no [abbr:dnd]-style attribute modifiers, or saves, or levels.
There is an experience mechanic but it's not experience points: like
Call of Cthulhu, when you successfully use a skill, you mark it, and then
in downtime you can try to improve what you marked.

At first the lack of saves threw me a bit.  I was planning to run some
[abbr:osr] content, and that stuff has "save vs X" *all over the
place!*  But it's actually pretty straightforward to translate saves
to skill checks:

- Is it some ongoing debilitating condition, like drowning?  Make a
  skill check every round and take damage whenever you fail, until the
  source of the problem goes away (or you die).

- Is it something the character could resist or avoid, like a dragon's
  firebreath or the effects of poison?  Make a skill check.

- Or is it purely up to chance?  Make a luck check.

The rulebook encourages the [abbr:gm] to make up new skills as needed, and
the provided *Blancmange & Thistle* scenario gives an example of that
for holding your breath.  Having weird niche skills isn't a problem in
Troika

### Cool Mechanics

The weirdness of Troika isn't confined to its setting, some of
the novelty budget gets spent on interesting mechanics:

- **Initiative** is done by putting a bunch of tokens in a bag,
  shaking it, and picking them out randomly: you don't know when, or
  even if, you'll get to act!

- **Damage** is done with charts mapping dice results to damage
  scores, making different weapons *feel* different.

- **Reaction rolls** are a staple of [abbr:osr] gaming, but in
  Troika each monster or animal type has its own reaction table,
  modelled after the personality of the creature.

- **Inventory slots** are numbered, and the order you store your items
  matters: things near the top can be withdrawn and used in a single
  combat round, whereas things near the bottom need a whole turn to
  take out.

## Backgrounds

Most of what differentiates [abbr:pc "PCs"] in Troika, at least to
start with, comes from their background.  These consist of a paragraph
or two of lore, a few items, some skills, and spells.

Character backgrounds in RPGs can often feel kind of boring.  Game
designers try to make each one appeal to a broad audience, and making
your own is generally hard (I'm sure we've all heard horror stories of
players *insisting* on using some horribly unbalanced homebrew race or
class).

Contrast that with Troika, where each background is evocative
and mechanically simple, and also just plain *weird*.  For example:

![Fellow of The Sublime Society of Beef Steaks: Brawlers believe the application of might and a good beef steak is the universal truth.  Words have no power and can no more define the universe than they can build a house, lift a cup, or sear a steak. Might can!  Really, they have thought a lot about this.](post/first-impressions-troika/beef-steaks.jpg)

There's a Grilling skill.  Why is there a Grilling skill?  What could
it be useful for?  I don't know, but simply seeing it on the page has
got me thinking about what sort of kitchen-related challenges I might
be able to feature in a game.

As a player I've never thought about this sort of character before,
but my mind went immediately to [Armstrong and Curtis from Fullmetal
Alchemist][].

There are 36 of these backgrounds.  Many of them reference people,
places, or things which don't get further explained.  Troika is
great for *implying* a setting without expecting you to learn a bunch
of detailed lore for *the* setting.

And I really like that.  When a game has an established setting, I
feel like I've got to *learn it* before I can run the game, or I'll
end up introducing inconsistencies.  Learning the lore of this
fictional place becomes homework, and I've never much enjoyed
geography or history.  Much better to give snippets of a setting which
I can flesh out into a more complete thing at the table.

## Preparing a Scenario

I wrote up my own adventure to run, which I'll publish in a separate
blog post.

I think the hardest part was getting the tone right, as I'd not run a
wacky science-fantasy game before.  The *Blancmange & Thistle*
scenario in the book was a great help, as I was able to crib ideas
from that.  It's full of small details like "a thick green carpet
floor that you sink several inches into" which are strange (why is the
carpet so deep?) and slightly uncomfortable (that carpet *must* be
gross).

There's also a wealth of Troika scenarios on itch.io, for
example the recent [Great Troika! Pocket Sphere Jam!][], so even if
the rulebook hadn't come with an example scenario I'd have been able
to make do.

The only thing I felt was missing were some guidelines for converting
content, particularly monster statblocks, from other [abbr:osr] games,
which tend to be based on [abbr:dnd].  Perhaps that's a bit unfair of
me.  For instance, I wouldn't expect a fantasy game based on the
Call of Cthulhu system to come with [abbr:dnd] conversion instructions.  But
Troika *is* often lumped into the general [abbr:osr] sphere.  I
ended up making up some rules which worked for the particular scenario
I ran.

## Playing the Game

It was nice and simple.  The rules aren't complex, and once I'd got
everyone's inventory sorted out we were good to go.  The players
needed to ask "is this a roll under or roll versus?" a few times, but
there was never any difficulty for me to resolve that.

Playing into the weirdness of the system was great.  One [abbr:pc]
found a mysterious vial of blue liquid, asked if they could tell what
it was, and I just made up a skill: "I don't know, make a Liquid
Identification check."

The game wasn't as lethal as we expected, but that was partly my fault
and partly luck, as the first part of the scenario was [Emmy
Allen's][] *[Gardens of Ynn][]*, a randomly generated garden-based
adventure, and they just didn't get many hostile monster encounters.
Only one in fact, and they didn't have much difficulty in dispatching
the ambulatory rice pudding which took umbrage to their presence.

Our sessions are only three hours long.  If we had longer sessions I'd
have extended the garden part, which would probably have upped the
danger.

We all enjoyed it, and I expect we'll be running another Troika
one-shot, probably with fresh characters, in the future.
