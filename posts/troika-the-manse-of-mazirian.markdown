This is a short adventure I wrote for my group's first experience of
Troika.  Here's the prompt I gave them:

> Your patron has sent you to a distant sphere, inhabited by Mazirian,
> a mighty magician.  None have seen him for centuries, and so he is
> presumed long-dead.
>
> You are to retrieve a priceless artefact: the lens from the eye of a
> god, which has the power of focusing on anything in creation, no
> matter how distant.
>
> But there will be magical booby traps, who-knows-what spells, and
> possibly even enslaved demons, in your way.

There are two parts to this adventure:

1. **The Gardens**

    Once a splendid affair which drew visitors from all across the
    multiverse, now sadly unkept and overgrown.  The magic which held
    it all together now decaying and wild.

    I used [Emmy Allen's][cavegirl] *[Gardens of Ynn][]* for this.  If
    you don't have a copy, there is an [online generator][].  Or you
    can make up your own wacky garden adventure.

    Troika, while usually considered in the [abbr:osr] sphere,
    isn't based on an old edition of [abbr:dnd].  So there's some
    conversion work to do.  I didn't want to convert the entire Ynn
    book ahead of time, so I made some generic conversion rules.  See
    the next section for these.

2. **The Manse**

    After struggling through the gardens, perhaps losing some of their
    companions on the way, the party finally arrive at the manse.
    It's a collection of elegant wooden buildings connected by wooden
    verandas and bridges, surrounded by a small well-maintained
    garden, with a little stream running through the middle.

The game starts with the party arriving at the entrance to the gardens
along with their hirelings (give them suitably weird names, like
"Precious Thimble" and "Skulldeath").

If the players run out of hirelings and need a new character, they can
find a changeling in the gardens, or a sleeping guest (who has been
asleep for a *very* long time) in the manse.  See the end of the post
for the changeling background.

The Gardens (of Ynn)
--------------------

The manse is the first location encountered in Depth 5, or whatever
works best with the time you have, and can always be seen in the
distance rising above the hedges and trees.

At the entrance there is a sign asking you to "please respect the
rules" and to "please donate towards the upkeep of the gardens".

The rules are:

1. Don't litter
2. Don't pick the plants
3. Keep off the grass
4. Beware (this has clearly been painted on later)

The donation box says "5" on it.  The [abbr:pc "PCs"] have a variety of
currencies and denominations in their pockets.  If they enter without
donating a suitable amount, they hear a disembodied tutting.

### Conversion to Troika

#### Sense of Self

Some Ynnian effects attack the character's psyche, represented
numerically as their Sense of Self stat.  The starting value is
`Charisma + Constitution`.  If using the "highest 3 of
`4d6`" approach to stat generation, this is a
slightly skewed normal distribution centred on 25.

Troika does not use the standard [abbr:dnd] six attributes.

Instead, use `Skill + Luck + 10`.  This has a smaller standard
deviation, but the right centre.  Except for the Zoanthrop, who double
their Sense of Self: their stunted mind shields them from memetic
attacks.

#### Saves

Troika does not use saves.

For ongoing debilitating status effects (drowning, burning, poisoning,
etc), use the "Drowning" rules (page 47).

For things which a character could actively try to resist or avoid,
use a skill test (page 40).

For things which are just up to chance, use luck (page 40).

#### Monsters

Convert stats as follows:

- **Skill:** attack bonus, min 2 (if unintelligent) or 5 (if intelligent).
- **Stamina:** HP, max 25.
- **Initiative:** 1 if slow, 3 if really fast, 2 otherwise.
- **Armour:** 1 ("as leather") or 2 ("as chain") or 3 ("as plate").
- **Damage type:** whatever seems appropriate.
- **Mien:** whatever seems appropriate.

The Manse
---------

![The manse of Mazirian](post/troika-the-manse-of-mazirian/manse.png)

- **Grey:** open walkways, verandas

    No musty enclosed corridors for this magician, no!  Wooden paths,
    and bridges, running around the outsides of the buildings.  A
    wooden barrier runs along the outside edges to prevent accidents.

    Some evil vines cross the corner next to 6, which will attack
    anyone who gets too close.

    A pair of wires run between 3 and 9, disappearing into the walls.

- **Yellow:** herb gardens

    A bit overgrown through lack of use, but still serviceable.  The
    herbs next to 9 are all known for their magical properties.  The
    herbs next to 6 are more mundane.

- **Blue:** running water

    A shallow and babbling brook, running through the middle of the
    manse.  Lily pads and aesthetically pleasing frogs dot the
    surface.

- **Green:** well-kept gardens

    Nice level grass, a healthy green, with carefully-placed flowers
    to enhance the look.  Not at all like the horrible wild magical
    gardens outside the manse.

### Danger

The main source of danger in the manse is a protective spell which
guards its contents.

If a [abbr:pc] tries to damage something, as they attack whatever has
caught their attention they rapidly turn into a pile of rats: first
growing a long tail, then whiskers, then finally exploding into a
dozen rats.  Two cat statues in the waiting hall animate and chase
down the hapless [abbr:pc].

A be-rat-ed [abbr:pc] returns to normal after avoiding harm for 10
rounds, at which point the cats lose interest and turn back into
statues.

### Rooms

1. **Waiting hall**

    A coat and hat rack next to the door, 8 chairs around the edges.
    In the alcoves two obsidian cat statues with eyes which follow the
    [abbr:pc "PCs"].  One statue is on a plinth engraved "INTEGRITY", the
    other "HONESTY".

    A green imp is dusting.

    *If any [abbr:pc "PCs"] are turned into rats:* the statues animate and
    pursue.

    *If they wait:* the [abbr:pc "PCs"] will see a blue imp walking past
    carrying Mazirian's breakfast.  A bowl of some furry-looking blue
    substance, which smells faintly of cinnamon.  The imp won't object
    to being followed.

    The imp can also be found by heading out onto the veranda.

    *On the rack:* 3 silk and fur coats (with matching hats).  In the
    pockets: 38 gold coins, a small ivory key (what that does is up to
    you), a pipe that lights with a click of the fingers.  A pigeon is
    quietly nesting in one of the hats.

2. **Guest rooms**

    They're nice.  A large single bed, an en-suite, a walk-in closet,
    and a writing desk.  The carpet is lime green, and so thick and
    soft that you sink several inches into it.  A chandelier provides
    light.

    *In one room:* the carpet is very frayed.  It is inhabited by a
    race of tiny carpet-people, who will take the arrival of a
    [abbr:pc] as the arrival of the prophesied Great Foot, herald of
    the end times.

    Several of them can gang up to attack a [abbr:pc].

    *In another room:* there is a sweet old lady in a blue shawl
    sitting on the bed, only visible through a mirror.  She is an
    inhabitant of the Mirror World, and is staying in the manse of
    Nairizam.

    The layouts of Nairizam's and Mazirian's manses are identical, and
    she knows where all of the rooms are.  Sound does not travel
    through the mirror, but physical markings on it do (and are
    reversed).

3. **Dining room**

    A long wooden table spans the room, surrounded by 9 armchairs.  4
    on each long side, 1 at the end.  The outer wall is solid glass,
    and is looking down from above the gardens.

    There is a tea set in the middle of the table.

    There is a cord next to the window.  Pulling it changes the view
    to somewhere else.  The window and the cord are connected to the
    telescope in Mazirian's workshop: the window shows what it is
    focused on, and the cord moves it.

4. **Lounge**

    4 comfy armchairs and a long sofa.  A fireplace in every corner.
    A large silver bowl hovering in the centre of the room.  A few
    bookcases with light reading.

    The silver bowl comes closer when you snap your fingers or
    whistle.  Always full of strong alcohol and improbable fruits.
    When drunk roll `1d6`: 1--3, feel confident
    and gain 1 stamina (even above maximum); 4--6: throw up and lose 1
    stamina.

    *If a [abbr:pc] throws up:* a purple imp with a mop and bucket of
    soapy water rushes in through the door and begins mopping the
    carpet.

    *On the bookcase:* books about gardening, plants, animals; a
    children's picture book about a Derivative Dwarf trying (and
    failing) to become a proper Dwarf; a full shelf of slim volumes
    which consist of every 5-character combination of a collection of
    symbols.

5. **Kitchen**

    Chaos.  A dozen imps of various colours dashing to and fro
    carrying bowls and plates and ingredients and pans, all yelling at
    each other.

    *If questioned:* the hubbub is because "honoured guests" are
    expected.  If questioned further about the guests, the imps
    describe the [abbr:pc "PCs"].

    The imps will eventually serve a meal for the [abbr:pc "PCs"] in the
    dining room.  They will run around in a panic trying to find the
    [abbr:pc "PCs"], to direct them to the meal.

6. **Store room**

    Piles of dirty laundry, all imp-sized, brooms, buckets, etc.  The
    back wall is cracked and has vines with large knife-like thorns
    poking through and growing along the wall.  The vines come from
    the gardens proper, and have invaded across the herb patch.  There
    is half of an imp on the ground next to the vines, and some of the
    vines are bloody.

    *If a [abbr:pc] approaches the vines:* they wave around
    undirectedly but threateningly and quickly.

7. **Toilet**

    The walls look grey and smudged.  There is an overpowering smell
    of mint.

8. **Servant's quarters**

    Drab.  Peeling wallpaper.  Six imp-sized beds crammed into each
    room.

    *In various rooms:* imps of assorted colours sleeping.  They're
    very deep sleepers, and can even be picked up.  They talk in their
    sleep.  A determined [abbr:pc] can wake up an imp.

    *In one room:* an orange imp peering into a shard of broken
    mirror, shaving a stubbly beard.

9. **Mazirian's workshop**

    A mess.  Books, parchments, gemstones, ink, pens, wands, all sorts
    of magical paraphernalia scattered across the huge desk and the
    floor around it.  Piles of books have long-since collapsed,
    scattering their contents about.  Making sense of the mess would
    take years of study.

    *On the desk:* is a neatly folded pair of white gloves embroidered
    with a star in gold thread.

    *In the corner:* a telescope suspended from a circular frame, and
    held above a circular platform.  The whole is made of gold,
    covered in mystical engravings (one familiar with magic will
    recognise these as charms against reciprocal observation), and
    very ornate.  The telescope can be moved to point freely within a
    sphere.

    A pair of wires run from the telescope up along the ceiling and
    south towards the dining room.  If the [abbr:pc "PCs"] experiment, they
    can see that adjusting the telescope adjusts the view through the
    dining room window, and pulling the cord adjusts the telescope.

    *Inside the telescope:* is the treasure the [abbr:pc "PCs"] have been
    sent to find.  A [abbr:pc] can safely dismantle the telescope if
    they are wearing the fancy wizard gloves.

10. **Mazirian's private library**

    An elaborate archival-moving-bookcase set-up, with an ornate hand
    crank to move the shelves around.  Dusty academic tomes.  A
    complete set, up to 321 years ago, of the annual *Journal of the
    Academy of Doors*.

    *If a [abbr:pc] touches the books:* they cannot remove them from
    the shelves and begin to turn into rats.  Wearing the fancy wizard
    gloves allows a [abbr:pc] to interact with the books.

    Amongst the books is Mazirian's Diary, which describes his
    wonderful telescope capable of focusing on anything in creation,
    and also his experiments with immortality and undeath...

11. **Main library**

    Mahogany floor.  Walnut bookcases.  Soft red velvet armchairs.
    The ceiling has a painting of some god or another giving a glowing
    stone tablet to a bearded man on a mountain.

    Owls have taken up residence atop the bookcases.

    One of the windows is open.  A green imp is standing on the
    shoulders of a purple imp and waving a stick at the window to try
    to close it.  The owls came through this window.

    *If a [abbr:pc] spends time in the library:* test Luck.  On success
    they find a book which lets them immediately try to Get Better at
    any Advanced Skill or Spell they have.  On a failure they get
    absorbed into reading something interesting but ultimately
    useless, perhaps use the list of fake books from Knock! for
    inspiration.

12. **Showroom**

    An array of dazzling magical treasures, tastefully arranged around
    the marble-floored room.  A skull with diamonds for eyes rests on
    one of the comfy armchairs.  A set of wooden frames holding up
    *The Blue Star Maps of Corda* form a miniature maze in the right
    half of the room.  On a large brass book stand is *The Anarchical
    Grimoire of Propylonic Discharges* (from Knock!).

    *If a [abbr:pc] moves the skull:* it asks to be put back, and will
    bite if able to reach.

    *If a [abbr:pc] wanders into the Star Maps:* test Astrology.  On
    failure, they are lost within the maps until found by another
    [abbr:pc].

    *If a [abbr:pc] tries to remove an item from the room, or damages
    an item:* rat magic!

13. **Mazirian's bedroom** *(above 9)*

    Dark.  A large double bed.  The shadowy outline of Mazirian
    himself, seemingly fast asleep.  A walk-in closet with a variety
    of fancy robes.

    Mazirian is dead.  So dead, in fact, that he has mummified.
    Despite that, the imps still loyally serve.

14. **Bathroom** *(above 9)*

    Shining white, a toilet well deserving of the epithet "porcelain
    throne", a large sink, a full bath (the base of which is a portal
    to a natural hot spring), a collection of very red and very soft
    towels, and a tube of "EXTREME WHITENING TOOTHPASTE, WITH BAKING
    SODA!"

    *If a [abbr:pc] swims through the bath-portal:* they emerge in a
    pool of hot water on Depth `d20+10` of the
    gardens.  The manse is faintly visible in the distance.

15. **Mazirian's storeroom** *(below 9)*

    A very "life"-like anatomical skeleton.  A box of empty glassware,
    of various sizes and shapes.  A smudged magic circle drawn in the
    centre of the floor in chalk.  A padded box (closed) with space
    for 4 Plasmic Cores, 1 remains.

16. **Kitchen storeroom** *(below 6)*

    Entirely consumed by the vines.  There are some shears (damage as
    knife) on the stairs.


Potential enemies
-----------------

### In the Gardens

Listed in the *Gardens of Ynn* book.  See the conversion notes
earlier.

### In the Manse

#### Animated Cat Statue

- **Skill:** 8
- **Stamina:** 12
- **Initiative:** 2
- **Damage type:** Large Beast
- **Mien:** none, they are either inanimate or aggressive.

Fiercely protective of the manse and its contents, but kind of stupid.
These automata will chase down any [abbr:pc] who has been turned into a
pile of rats, but will lose interest the moment the [abbr:pc] recovers.

#### Gang of Carpet People

- **Skill:** 1
- **Stamina:** 1
- **Initiative:** 3
- **Damage type:** Small Beast / 2
- **Mien:** intelligent.

A collection of tiny humanoids who dwell within the carpet of one of
Mazirian's guest rooms.  The imps tolerate them because they eat dust.
They will regard the arrival of a [abbr:pc] as the arrival of the
prophesied Great Foot, herald of the end times.

#### Imp

- **Skill:** 5
- **Stamina:** 3
- **Initiative:** 2
- **Damage type:** Small Beast
- **Mien:** intelligent

Utterly servile, obsessed with cleanliness (except in their private
spaces), and still following the last commands Mazirian gave to them
before his death.  They don't have a very good grasp of time, so they
haven't yet noticed that their master hasn't left his bed in a while.

#### Owl

- **Skill:** 4
- **Stamina:** 4
- **Initiative:** 3
- **Damage type:** Small Beast
- **Mien:** animal

Just a regular owl who, much to the annoyance of the imps, has decided
that the library is a fine place to nest.

#### Talking Skull

- **Skill:** 5
- **Stamina:** 20
- **Initiative:** 1
- **Damage type:** Axe
- **Mien:** intelligent

Whose skull is it?  Why is it here?  These and other questions will
have to remain unanswered, as you can't have memories without brains,
and the skull is sadly lacking in that department.

#### Vines

- **Skill:** 1
- **Stamina:** 10
- **Initiative:** 4
- **Damage type:** Knife
- **Mien:** none, the vines are either dormant or aggressive.

Strangely aggressive thorny vines which have invaded from the magical
gardens.  They have no eyes, detectable ones at least, but they react
violently to nearby motion.

### Miens

Rather than write a mien table for everything, I made three templates.

#### Intelligent

1. Sleeping
2. Playful
3. Hungry
4. Quizzical
5. Paranoid
6. Aggressive (or cautious)

#### Animal

1. Lazy
2. Eating
3. Hungry
4. Territorial
5. Crafty
6. Aggressive (or cautious)

#### Other

1. Dormant
2. Stationary
3. Unstable
4. Probing
5. Ignoring the [abbr:pc "PCs"] and doing its own thing
6. Aggressive (or cautious)


Changeling background
---------------------

From [Troika! - Mucking about in the Gardens of Ynn](https://the-last-redoubt.blogspot.com/2019/07/troika-mucking-about-in-gardens-of-ynn.html):

> You've been marooned in the Gardens for quite some time.  Perhaps
> you were a foolhardy adventurer or inquisitive gardener.  Perhaps
> you wandered here as a child and have known nothing else.  Trapped
> here in the Garden for so long, you've adapted to your new home a
> little too well and aren't entirely human anymore.  On the bright
> side you're aren't entirely a strange vampiric fey yet!  It's just

**Possessions:**

- Hooked Nails & Numerous Needle Teeth (damage as Knife).
- Book of gardening techniques, poetic ramblings and strange doodles in the margins.
- Garden Tools and a Rusty Rake (damage as Staff).
- Worn Clothes, covered with growths of vines and flowers. +2 to Sneak rolls in vegetation.
- Butterfly Wings (+1 Fly) or Strange Eyes (+4 Second Sight).

**Skills :**

- 4 Language - Birdsong
- 3 Gardening
- 2 Claw Fighting
- 2 Sneak
- 2 Forage
- 1 Climb
- 1 Staff Fighting

**Special:**

You don't recover Stamina by eating a Provision---instead you may
consume a mouthful of blood (`1d6` Stamina from
any willing or unwilling volunteers) at most 3 times per day to
recover an equivalent amount of Stamina.

You cannot recover Stamina in sunlight but recover twice as
effectively in darkness and are severely allergic to iron and holy
objects.  You take double damage from such sources and take damage
while touching or carrying such objects.  Don't even try to go on holy
ground.

If you are reduced to negative Stamina, instead of dying you are
transformed into a patch of flowers or mushrooms growing where your
body falls.  Regain 1 Stamina twice per day (sunrise and sunset) until
you are fully healed.  You return to flesh when your Stamina is fully
recovered or blood soaks into the ground you're growing in.  A stake
in the heart prevents this and freezes you at 0 Stamina until it is
removed.  Churning up the soil you're growing in destroys you forever.
