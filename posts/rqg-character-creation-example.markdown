title: A worked example of RuneQuest character creation
date: 2023-08-05
topic: mechanics
system: rqg
excerpt: |
    I'm gearing up to run a one-shot of [glo:rqg], but I found bits of the
    character creation pretty confusing.  So here is a full worked example based
    on my current understanding of the rules.
---

[glo:rqg] is probably the crunchiest game I've looked into running.  It's based
on the same "basic roleplaying system" as [glo:coc], but set in a high-magic
bronze-age fantasy context, and *significantly* more complex.  That said, I
think the character creation does a pretty good job of gradually introducing
this complexity without being overwhelming, but there were a few aspects which
confused me and made me turn to the internet to get help.

So, without further ado, let's get into the creation of **Orstan the Exemplar**,
warrior and chariot driver of the Hiording clan.  You'll need a copy of the core
rulebook to follow along.  If you just want to see the finished character, jump
to the end.


## Character Creation

### Step 1: Homeland

Since the one-shot I'm running is going to be set in Sartar, I picked that.
This gives our character three starting passions: **Love (family)** 60%,
**Loyalty (clan)** 60%, and **Loyalty (tribe)** 60%.

I also decided to pick a name, tribe, and clan (which is actually done in step
8) at this point too: I called my character **Orstan the Exemplar**, and decided
he's from the Hiording clan of the Colymar tribe.  I picked the Colymar because
the core rulebook describes them as a "default" tribe for adventurers (in the
same way that Sartar is a "default" homeland for adventurers), and I picked the
Hiording clan totally arbitrarily.

This gives an additional **Loyalty (Colymar Tribe)** +10%, which stacks with our
current **Loyalty (tribe)**.  Not all tribes or clans give an additional bonus.

Incidentally, I came up with the name "Orstan" by giving ChatGPT the example
male Sartarite names from the core rulebook and asking for more like that.  Here
are some more random names:

- **Male:** Kordar, Dangor, Brondil, Hengor, Garstan, Thandar, Kallor, Ulvar,
  Orstan, Varlorn
- **Female:** Althila, Brondis, Caeluma, Daeliska, Erevaya, Frayna, Grevina,
  Heldara, Iskarna, Jovsara, Kaelana

#### Orstan at the end of Step 1

- **Passions:** Love (family) 60%, Loyalty (Hiording clan) 60%, Loyalty (Colymar
  tribe) 70%

### Step 2: Family History

I love lifepath character creation systems, but I decided to skip over the
history of Orstan's grandparents and parents, just focussing on his personal
history.  That's what I'll do in my one-shot, to save time.  But if we decide to
play a campaign of RuneQuest, we'll definitely do the full character creation.

#### 1622

As Orstan is from Sartar, I rolled [glo:dice-notation "`1d20+5`"] to see what he
was doing.  I got a 13: Orstan was dealing with the Great Winter.

Rolling [glo:dice-notation "`1d20`"] on the Great Winter table, I got a 5,
meaning he nearly froze to death.  Rolling on the subtable ([glo:dice-notation
"`1d6`"] this time), I got a 6, so Orstan survived by fleeing to Esrolia and
fighting in the civil war there.

Rolling [glo:dice-notation "`1d20+5`"] on the Civil War in Esrolia table this
time, I got a 22.  Orstan fought gloriously protecting Queen Samastina from Red
Earth assassins, gaining **Honour** 60%, **Loyalty (Queen Samastina)** 60%, and
**Reputation** +[glo:dice-notation "`1d6`"]% (for which I rolled a 3).

#### 1623

No modifiers for Sartarites this time, so just a straight [glo:dice-notation
"`1d20`"] roll.  I got an 8, which means that it was a normal year for Orstan
and nothing really happened.

#### 1624

No modifier for this roll either, so a straight [glo:dice-notation "`1d20`"].  I
got a 20, meaning Orstan fought at the Battle of Pennel Ford.

Rolling [glo:dice-notation "`1d20+10`"] on the Pennel Ford table, I got a 21,
which means that he fought with great glory, gaining **Honour** +10%, **Battle**
+10%, and **Reputation** +[glo:dice-notation "`1d6`"]% (for which I rolled a 3).

Some skills start at a value other than 0.  **Battle** starts at 10%, so Orstan
now has **Battle** 20%.

I then chose whether Orstan accompanied Argrath to the summoning of Jaldon
Goldentooth, or aided Harrek the Berserk in sacking the City of Wonders.  I
chose the summoning, rolling [glo:dice-notation "`1d20`"] on that table, and got
a 6: Orstan acknowledged Argrath as the White Bull, gaining **Loyalty (White
Bull)** 60%.

#### 1625

No modifier for this roll either, [glo:dice-notation "`1d20`"] again, and I
rolled a 13.  Orstan witnessed a several-kilometer-long dragon explode out of
the ground and destroy a temple-city of the Lunar Empire, then he took up arms
and fought in the Liberation of Sartar!

Rolling [glo:dice-notation "`1d20`"] on the Liberation of Sartar table, I got a
1.  Orstan fought with great glory, gaining **Honour** +10%, **Loyalty
(Sartar)** 60%, **Reputation** +[glo:dice-notation "`1d3`"]% (for which I rolled
a 1), and **Battle** +10%.

The game begins in 1625, so now we're ready to leave history behind and look to
Orstan's future.

#### Orstan at the end of Step 2

- **Passions:** Honour 70%, Love (family) 60%, Loyalty (Hiording clan) 60%,
  Loyalty (Colymar tribe) 70%, Loyalty (Queen Samastina) 60%, Loyalty (White
  Bull) 60%, Loyalty (Sartar) 60%
- **Reputation:** 9%
- **Skills:**
    - *Knowledge:* Battle 20%

### Step 3: Rune Affinities

At this point I paused to read the rest of the character creation chapter and
the chapters on runes, rune cults, and rune magic.  Runes are a big deal, both
in the setting and also mechanically, so it's difficult to pick rune affinities
without knowing the wider context.

Based on Orstan's history, I decided he should be a warrior type, probably in
the cult of Orlanth Adventurous, which means he needed an **Air** or
**Movement** rune affinity of at least 50%.

I think this step should be swapped with step 4 (rolling characteristics), as if
you end up rolling a frail but smart character you'd probably want to choose a
different cult (and so want different rune affinities) than if you roll a strong
character.  Characteristics don't matter a huge amount, but a weak character
will have fewer hit points and may not be able to use some weapons.

But let's just hope the characteristics work out for a warrior, and continue.

Due to being from Sartar, Orstan automatically gets **Air** +10%.  I then chose
**Air**, **Earth**, and **Fire** for his elemental rune affinities, giving them
+60%, +40%, and +20% respectively.  Those runes are associated with:

- Being passionate, violent, proud, and unpredictable.
- Being pragmatic, prudent, worldly, and sensual.
- Being pure, chaste, idealistic, and perceptive.

After that, I chose to make **Harmony** and **Movement** his primary power /
form runes, setting those each to 75% and their opposites (**Disorder** and
**Stasis**) to 25%.  Those runes are associated with:

- Putting the welfare of one's community above one's own; versus putting one's
  own welfare, advantage, or pleasure above all others.
- Being changeable, energetic, rebellious, and ambitious; versus being resolute
  and unchanging.

At this point I was starting to develop this idea of a passionate and honourable
warrior who lives for the battlefield and is somewhat less comfortable in
civilised society.  The kind of larger-than-life sword-and-sorcery heroic type:
everything Orstan does is boisterous and over-the-top, but he cares deeply about
his friends and community and would happily sacrifice himself to protect them.

Finally, for the additional 50 points you get to distribute across all the
runes, I went for **Air** +10%, **Earth** +10%, **Beast** +10% (and so **Man**
-10%), **Fertility** +15% (and so **Death** -15%), and **Movement** +5% (and so
**Stasis** -5%).  Beast / Man and Fertility / Death are associated with:

- Being bestial, savage, feral, wild, and untamed, preferring the wilderness to
  cultivated lands; versus being civilised, settled, sociable, and ethical.
- Enjoying the pleasures of the flesh and being generous and giving; versus
  separating oneself from the material world and seeking to deny the world of
  the senses, being relentless and ruthless.

I felt these fit well with this passionate warrior feeling I was going for.  He
prefers the battlefield and the festival to the farm or the marketplace.

#### Orstan at the end of Step 3

- **Runes:** Air 80%, Earth 50%, Fire 20%, Man 40% / Beast 60%, Fertility 65% /
  Death 35%, Harmony 75% / Disorder 25%, Stasis 20% / Movement 80%
- **Passions:** Honour 70%, Love (family) 60%, Loyalty (Hiording clan) 60%,
  Loyalty (Colymar tribe) 70%, Loyalty (Queen Samastina) 60%, Loyalty (White
  Bull) 60%, Loyalty (Sartar) 60%
- **Reputation:** 9%
- **Skills:**
    - *Knowledge:* Battle 20%

Rune affinities of 80% of more strongly affect the character's personality, so
Orstan is especially passionate, energetic, unpredictable, violent, and proud.

### Step 4: Characteristics

There's a sidebar with some suggestions for how to change the process if you
want slightly better characteristics than average (for example, rerolling 1s),
but I just went for the default:

- **STR:** [glo:dice-notation "`3d6`"]: 12
- **DEX:** [glo:dice-notation "`3d6`"]: 10
- **CON:** [glo:dice-notation "`3d6`"]: 10
- **POW:** [glo:dice-notation "`3d6`"]: 12
- **CHA:** [glo:dice-notation "`3d6`"]: 13
- **SIZ:** [glo:dice-notation "`2d6+6`"]: 11
- **INT:** [glo:dice-notation "`2d6+6`"]: 13

From Orstan's **Air** I took **STR** +2, and from his **Earth**, **CON** +1.

Unlike some of the other homelands, Sartar doesn't give any additional
characteristic modifiers.

Then I noted down all the derived attributes: magic points, hit points, healing
rate, damage bonus, spirit combat damage, maximum encumbrance, strike rank, and
skill category modifiers.  They're all pretty straightforward, though one thing
I overlooked when I first read this section is that the manipulation skills
category modifier also applies to all the weapon skills.  It's there in the
text, but every other category modifier has a section heading, so I missed that
the weapon skills were covered as part of something else at first.

#### Homeland Skill Bonuses

Finally, every homeland gives bonuses to some skills.  I found the treatment of
weapon skills here a little confusing.

RuneQuest puts all weapons skills into categories: for example, **1H Axe**
covers both small axes and battle axes, and there's also a separate **2H Axe**
skill which covers battle axes (I guess using them one- or two-handed is
different enough to be a different skill), great axes, and dagger-axes.

The rulebook says that if you get a bonus to a weapon *category*, you have to
pick a specific weapon *skill* to apply that bonus to.  So if you get a bonus to
**1H Spear** then that means your character starts the game particularly good
with *one specific sort* of one-handed spear, and not *all* one-handed spears.

But the character sheet doesn't support that!

The character sheet has a confusing mixture of category-skills like **1H Axe**
and weapon-skills like **Broadsword**, with no space to write down which
one-handed axe you have that **1H Axe** skill in.

I found [a thread on the BRP forum][] with a useful reply by Jason D, a
line-editor for RuneQuest:

[a thread on the BRP forum]: https://basicroleplaying.org/topic/11958-cultural-weapon-skills-are-a-bit-vague/

And so, in not having space to note down the specific weapons, the character
sheet is just wrong.

I think the character sheet should leave all the weapon skills blank, or format
them like "**1H Axe (_____):** __%" so there's space to write in the specialism,
and I also think that the rulebook could have been written a *little* more
carefully to avoid having weapon-categories with the same names as
weapon-skills.

Anyway, with that confusion out of the way, Orstan gained the following skill
bonuses: **Ride (any)** +5%, **Dance** +5%, **Sing** +10%, **Speak Own Language
(Heortling)** 50%, **Speak Other Language (Tradetalk)** +10%, **Customs
(Heortling)** 25%, **Farm** +20%, **Herd** +10%, **Spirit Combat** +15%,
**Dagger** +10%, **1H Axe (Battle Axe)** +10%, **1H Spear (Lance)** +10%,
**Broadsword** +15%, **Composite Bow** +10%, **Javelin** +10%, **Medium Shield**
+15%, **Large Shield** +10%.

Many of those skills have a nonzero starting value, so they'll be higher than
those bonuses.  And note that **Speak Own Language (Heortling)** and **Customs
(Heortling)** aren't *bonuses*, those values *replace* the starting values.

#### Orstan at the end of Step 4

- **STR** 14 **DEX** 10 **CON** 11 **POW** 12 **CHA** 13 **SIZ** 11 **INT** 13,
  **HP** 11 **DEX SR** 3 **SIZ SR** 2

- **Reputation:** 9%
- **Damage Bonus:** +[glo:dice-notation "`1d4`"]
- **Spirit Combat Damage:** [glo:dice-notation "`1d6+1`"]

Hit Location  | [glo:dice-notation "`1d20`"] | Armour | HP
------------- | ---------------------------- | ------ | --
Right Leg     | 1--4                         | 0      | 4
Left Leg      | 5--8                         | 0      | 4
Abdomen       | 9--11                        | 0      | 4

Right Arm     | 13--15                       | 0      | 3
Left Arm      | 16--18                       | 0      | 3
Head          | 19--20                       | 0      | 4

With his above-average STR and average DEX, I think Orstan is well-suited to
being a warrior.

### Step 5: Occupation

I decided that Orstan would be a **Chariot Driver**.  His job is to transport a
temple's Rune Masters (warrior-priests) around the battlefield.  This felt way
more cool than just being a regular warrior: driving a chariot into the midst of
a battlefield while a muscular blue-painted guy stands behind you flinging
lightning around as arrows rain down!

As a chariot driver, Orstan gained: **Battle** +20%, **First Aid** +10%, **Drive
Chariot** +40%, **Whip** +25%, **1H Axe (Battle Axe)** +20%, **Dance** +15%,
**Javelin** +20%, **Scan** +15%, **Honour** +10% (really going all in on the
honour).

He also gains [glo:dice-notation "`1d6`"] distinctive scars.  I rolled a 4, and
decided at one point he was mauled, or slashed, or something, on the right side
of his body, so he has scars on his face, down the right side of his chest, and
really bad scarring on his right arm.

#### Whip?  What whip?

Chariot drivers get a bonus to whip, but there's no whip skill on the character
sheet.

No problem, I'll just check the weapon list in the combat chapter... and there's
no whip there either.  I searched the PDF for "whip": no stats.  Did none of the
playtesters create a chariot driver?  How did the absence of a starting skill /
weapon just not get noticed?  I don't know if it's in the equipment book (I
don't have that), but if it's referenced in the core rulebook, *as a thing you
can get in character creation no less*, it should be described in the core
rulebook.

After some googling, I found [a blog post][] with some plausible stats which I
decided to go for, though I reduced the range from 5m to 2m, because a 5m whip
sounds unwieldy.  But just forgetting to include the stats for a weapon is a
poor look.

[a blog post]: http://2ndage.blogspot.com/2020/01/whip-weapon-stats-rqg.html

#### Starting equipment

Unfortunately, when I then turned to starting equipment, I was confused again.
The rulebook says:

> The equipment section also lists the adventurer as having their "cultural
> weapons." This means that the adventurer owns one of each weapon they can
> use. An adventurer could own all of the weapons listed if the player spread
> the adventurer's experience among all those weapon skills.

But, since a "cultural weapon" is a weapon you get a bonus to simply for being
from a place, isn't that *always* the case?  Sartarites get **Dagger** +10%,
**Battle Axe** +10%, **1H Spear** +10%, **Broadsword** +15%, **Composite Bow**
+10% or **Sling** +10%, **Javelin** +10%, **Medium Shield** +15%, and **Large
Shield** +10%.  So does that mean every Sartarite character starts the game
carrying around a dagger, battle axe, spear, broadsword, bow or sling, javelin,
and two shields?

Not only is that more weapons than a warrior gets (since the warrior occupation
doesn't give cultural weapons), there's not enough space on the character sheet
to write them all down!

So [I turned to reddit][], and the response was... inconclusive.  One vote for
"up to you", one vote for "you get everything", and two votes for "you get the
cultural weapons you put occupational, cult, or personal skill points into".  I
decided to go for that last interpretation, since it seems the most sensible to
me.

[I turned to reddit]: https://old.reddit.com/r/Runequest/comments/15idpt3/question_about_starting_cultural_weapons_in_rqg/

If the character creation example in the core rulebook had used just about any
other occupation, this would have been made clear.  Oh well.

Javelin (thrown) | 45 | [glo:dice-notation "`1d10`"]          | 20m   | 8  | 3  |

As an aside, I think there's a mistake in Vasana, the example character in the
core rulebook, who has Strike Rank 7 for their broadsword, battle axe, and
medium shield, despite the broadsword having a base Strike Rank of 2 and both
the battle axe and medium shield having a base Strike Rank of 3.

### Step 6: Cult

I chose the **Orlanth Adventurous** cult, because it's a popular warrior cult in
Sartar.

For joining a cult of Orlanth, Orstan gained 3 rune points, **Cult Lore
(Orlanth)** +15%, **Worship (Orlanth)** +20%, **Meditate** +5%, **Orate** +15%,
**Speak Other Language (Stormspeech)** +20%, **Sing** +20%, and all common rune
spells.

I find it a little strange that **Cult Lore** and **Worship** have nonzero
starting values (5% each).

For joining Orlanth Adventurous specifically, Orstan gained +10% to any sword
skill, so I chose **Broadsword**.  For the additional +20% and +15% bonuses, I
chose **Sing** and **Orate**, respectively.  And for the favoured passion I took
**Devotion (Orlanth)** 60%.

Finally, I had to choose 3 rune magic spells and 5 points of spirit magic
spells.  I decided on **Lightning**, **Shield**, and **Wind Warp** for the rune
magic (being able to turn the wind to favour my javelin throws sounds awesome),
and **Bladesharp 2**, **Mobility**, **Fanaticism**, and **Protection 1** for
spirit magic.

### Step 7: Personal Skill Bonuses

For Orstan's four 25% skill bonuses I picked his weapon skills: **1H Axe (Battle
Axe)**, **Broadsword**, **Whip**, and **Javelin**.

Then for the five 10% skill bonuses I picked **Battle**, **Speak Other Language
(Tradetalk)**, **Worship (Orlanth)**, **Scan**, and **Medium Shield**.

Finally, I noted down related languages: **Speak Other Language (Esrolian)**
25%, **Speak Other Language (Old Pavic)** 10%, and **Speak Other Language
(Tarshite)** 10%.  The rules say to note these skills down, because you get them
for free during character creation but after this point they have to be trained
independently, but there wasn't much space for them on the character sheet.  I
had to use the three "other skills" slots, which leaves no room for anything
else.

### Step 8: Other Information

Since I already picked a name, tribe, and clan, I didn't have much to do here.
Just roll Orstan's birthday (Godsday of Movement Week in Air Season), note down
his starting **Reputation** +10%, and roll [glo:dice-notation "`1d20`"] for a
family heirloom.

I got a 19: an ostentatious metal helmet (worth 3x normal price) containing a
2-point spirit magic matrix Protection.

And we're done!


## Orstan the Exemplar

*Initiate of Orlanth Adventurous.  Male, age 21.  Chariot driver of the Hiording
clan of the Colymar Tribe.*

> I am Orstan, son of Andrin, of the Hiording clan.  I live for battle, glory,
> and passion; civilisation bores me.  I serve my clan as a chariot driver,
> bringing the Rune Masters to our foes and striking them down through might and
> magic!  I fought to free Esrolia, routed the Lunars at Pennel Ford, and drove
> them from Sartar in the wake of the Dragonrise.  I will strike down all who
> threaten those I hold dear.  The scars on my body bear witness to my devotion.
>
> My friends know me as much for my boisterous laughter and wild partying as for
> my skill at arms.  Some consider me inconsistent and changeable, but my honour
> and my commitment to the clan never waver.
