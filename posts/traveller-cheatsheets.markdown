In my [How to Learn a New System][] post, I said that I like to make
cheatsheets before embarking on a full campaign, and I gave a
cheatsheet I'd made for Traveller as an example.

This post has an updated version of *that* sheet, and all my *other*
Traveller sheets.  I've been using these for a few months now
(except for the space piracy one, which is fairly new), and these are
the first things I get out when sitting down to run a session.

These sheets are for Mongoose Traveller 2e, using the pre-2022-update
rulebook.  I don't think the 2022 core rulebook update significantly
changed anything, but if you have that you should double-check before
using these.

## The Sheets

**[Basics](post/traveller-cheatsheets/basics.pdf)**, covering:

- Checks (with the optional luck rule from the Traveller Companion)
- Combat
- Damage
- Healing
- Common weapon traits
- My house rules for healing and rumour gathering

I know this more or less off by heart now, I don't need to look at it
much.  But it's handy to have open just in case.

And here is [a version without the house rules](post/traveller-cheatsheets/basics-no-houserules.pdf).

**[Spacecraft](post/traveller-cheatsheets/spacecraft.pdf)**, covering:

- Common skill checks
- Skimming fuel from gas giants
- Running costs
- Jump travel and misjumps
- Damage and repairs
- Common travel times
- The challenges of being in space: zero-G, life support, and exposure
  to vacuum and radiation
- Space combat (including the critical hits table and examples)

This one is three pages.  Not ideal, but I refer to it all frequently.

**[Universal World Profile (UWP)](post/traveller-cheatsheets/uwp.pdf)**,
covering:

- How to read a UWP
- Starport qualities, berthing and fuel costs, and facilities
- Trade codes
- Travel zones

I mostly use this for the list of berthing costs.  I'm using the
official Traveller setting in my campaign, so I can use the
excellent [travellermap.com][], rather than needing to decode UWPs
myself.

**[Piracy](post/traveller-cheatsheets/piracy.pdf)**, a recent addition
based on the Pirates of Drinax books, covering:

- Common skill checks
- Lists of random ships by type
- Attacking other ships: distress signals, morale, and looting times
- Piracy response from local world governments
- Piracy response from the Third Imperium and Aslan Hierate
- Refuelling times
- Stealing ships
- Transferring cargo in zero-G
- NPC crew: salaries, morale, and dividing the spoils

Also a three-pager, but the third page just covers NPC crew, and which
I don't expect to need to refer to very frequently.
