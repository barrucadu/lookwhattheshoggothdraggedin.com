title: Knock! An Adventure Gaming Bric-a-brac (#1)
date: 2021-02-16
topic: reviews
excerpt: |
    Knock! is a recently kickstarted zine full of goodness from the OSR
    blogosphere.  It's wonderfully designed, and crammed with
    information.  There's a nice mix of stuff which is immediately
    useful (like *Just Use Bears*, or the *Dungeon Checklist*), and
    some more thought-provoking articles too.  Plus some great art.  I
    recommend it, and am looking forward to issue #2!

[Knock!][] is a recently kickstarted zine full of goodness from the
[glo:osr] blogosphere.  It's wonderfully designed, and crammed with
information: the inside of the dust cover has a dungeoncrawl, the book
cover itself has a demon generator, and the bookmark is a grimoire!

There's not much original content in this issue, but that's fine
because there's a lot of great blog posts out there!  There's a [call
for contributions][] open now, so we should see more original content
that in future issues.

## What's in the book

Most of the book is blog posts and random tables (user adventurearth
has put together a [list of links on /r/osr][]), then towards the end
there's 60 pages of maps, monsters, new classes, and a few short
adventures.

There's some big names from the [glo:osr] scene.  A few I recognised
are [Emmy Allen][] (cavegirl), [Arnold K][] (Goblin Punch), [Ben
Milton][] (Questing Beast), and [Gavin Norman][] (Necrotic Gnome).

![Excerpts of art.](files/knock-issue-1/art.jpg)

I've found immediate practical use from a few of the articles:

- [Monster Design from Classics - The Lich][] and [Just Use Bears][], for monster design.
- [Dungeon Checklist][] and [The Labors of Hercules as OSR Obstacles][], for adventure design.
- [8 statues encounters][], where I've just lifted one for an adventure I'm writing.

I love this "something to experiment with" from the *Dungeon
Checklist*:

> A boat golem that flees from loud noises.  You can direct it by
> standing at the back of it and shouting.

Such a fun image.

There are a few more "theory" heavy articles, like [Leaving Kansas][],
that I want to return to and think about some more.

Other than in paper size, the book really feels like a magazine.  The
pages are nice and glossy, there's art on almost every two-page
spread, and each article has a distinct layout.

It might sound jarring, but the art-heavy varied-layout style really
works in this case, because the articles are all independent.

## My only complaints

Are very minor, really.  Certainly not show-stoppers.

Firstly, the spine is printed upside down.  Look at it compared to
some of my other RPG books:

![Part of my RPG bookcase, showing the text on the spine of Knock! is oriented differently.](files/knock-issue-1/spine.jpg)

Apparently that might be a French thing.

Secondly, there's a surprising number of typos!  It's clear that a
*lot* of effort went into the layout of this zine, so it's surprising
to me that there are issues like missing spaces or misspelled words.
The *Useless Magical Loot* article is particularly bad for this.

Even the foreword, right at the start of the book, misspells
"millenials" (should have two "n"s).

And finally, there are a few small inconsistencies in the text.  Like
the spine saying "An **Old School** Gaming Bric-a-**B**rac" but the
inside cover saying "An **Adventure** Gaming Bric-a-**b**rac".

None of these are major problems though, and I've seen a few other
people mention them, so I hope the editing will improve a bit for
issue #2.
