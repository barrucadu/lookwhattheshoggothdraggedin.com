In late 2019 / early 2020, a global pandemic started, governments
imposed lockdowns, and people had to choose between moving their games
online or abandoning them for the foreseeable future.  Not me though,
as I was already running my game online.  In fact, other than a single
one-shot, all of my games have been online.

I don't even have enough dice to run an in-person game.


## Step One: Form a Group

Talk to people you've already played with (though not everyone likes
the idea of playing online, so don't be disappointed if they say no),
talk to online friends, ask around online communities you're a part
of, even ask total strangers (using communities like [/r/lfg][] and
[/r/lfgmisc][] on reddit) if you're open to meeting new people.

This is much like getting a group together for an in-person game,
except you're not constrained by geography.  Make sure not to fall
afoul of [Geek Social Fallacy #4][].

You want to end up with a group of people who broadly agree on:

- When the game will be.

- What sort of game you'll be playing.

- Whether you're using voice or text chat (I recommend voice, unless
  you're intentionally forming a [glo:pbp] group).

- Whether you're using webcams or not.

You can flesh out the details in a [session 0][].

I prefer to come up with a fixed schedule in advance.  Given how much
stress session-by-session scheduling seems to cause people, I think
cutting that particular Gordian knot is a GMing superpower.

But some people prefer scheduling session-by-session.  Or have such
unpredictable lives that they can't commit to anything more than a few
weeks in the future.  [Doodle][] is a great tool for determining
player availability if you need it.

## Step Two: Pick Your Tools

You are going to want:

- A way to communicate outside of sessions.  Email, [Discord][], or a
  [Steam][] group chat all work for this.

- A place to put session notes and similar artefacts.  A wiki, a
  forum, or even a persistent group chat can do this.

- A virtual tabletop.  [Roll20][] is the old incumbent, [Fantasy
  Grounds][] and [Foundry][] are also popular.

- A tool for voice and, if you want it, video chat.  Discord and
  [Skype][] can do both, Steam can do voice.

If you decide to do away with the virtual tabletop (maybe you
exclusively do [glo:pbp]; or you really commit to [glo:totm] and don't
even use handouts), I recommend using some dice rolling tool, like
[Dice Maiden][] for Discord.

I run a fairly [glo:totm]-heavy game, but I will still sometimes draw
out a map, or a strange symbol the [glos:pc] found.  I find things
like that much easier to communicate visually, and I don't think "try
to figure out the layout of the dungeon from the [glo:gm]'s
description" is a particularly fun part of the game.

## Step Three: Plan Your Session

Running a session online isn't *that* different to running one
offline.  But one big difference is that you don't get any visual cues
for how your players feel.  So there are some matters of timing which
you can wing in person, but are better to decide and communicate
up-front when online.

### When does the game begin?

How much time for non-game chatter do you allow at the start of your
session?  And how long do you wait for stragglers?

You don't want one person to be sat quietly wanting you to just get on
with the game while some others are happily chatting away.  Or for one
player to think they're arriving at a good time, but someone else
thinks that they're consistently late.  Make sure everyone's on the
same page about when the game actually begins.

### When are the breaks?

It can be hard for you to tell if someone needs a break, and it can be
hard for the person who needs one to tell if now is a good time to
quickly step out of the room, or if they need to interrupt you and
pause the session.

Decide when the breaks will be in advance and let everyone know.  Then
someone can decide if they *really* need to interrupt, or if they can
wait a bit longer.

I've found a 10-minute break every hour and a half to two hours works
well.

## Step Four: Play!

You're now ready to go.

Things will go wrong.  There will be technical issues.  Someone will
mute themselves and then wonder why everybody is talking over them.
Someone's internet connection will go down.  A microphone or a webcam
will break.  People will be late.

These things happen, especially at the beginning when everyone's
getting used to it.  But eventually you'll all figure it out and it
will go more smoothly.

Never perfectly smooth, but not as chaotic as those first sessions.


## The Tools I Use

My preferences are [Discord][] for text chat between sessions, and
voice chat during them (though one of my groups is using [Steam][]
chat); and [Roll20][] as a virtual tabletop and forum for session
notes.
