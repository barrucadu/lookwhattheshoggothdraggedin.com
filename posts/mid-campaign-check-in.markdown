    Campaigns can be huge games which last years.  Players might come
    and go.  People's tastes might change.  What you decided the
    campaign would be about one, two, or more years ago might not be
    what the players want any more.  So, hold a mid-campaign check-in
    to ask about how everyone is finding the game and whether anything
    needs to change.

Campaigns can be huge games which last years.  The campaign I'm
currently running has been going for more than a year already, we've
gone through some big story arcs in that time, and a few months ago I
found myself wondering if the game I was running was still the game
the players wanted to play.

I had no reason to suspect this---nobody had expressed any
discontent---but sometimes it's hard to say you're not having fun when
everyone else is.

So I sent around a little survey:

> The game's been running for a while now, and we've just hit a
> milestone, so I thought this is a good time to check in on how
> you're all finding things.  So, how's it going?
>
> Here are some prompts for thought:
>
> - What have you liked the most?
> - What have you liked the least?
> - Are you still happy with your character?
> - Have there been any times when the mechanics felt wonky or unhelpful?
> - Is the schedule still good?
> - How about the session length?
> - Is there anything you think we / I should change?

I'd not done this before, I'm sure I saw the idea somewhere but I
can't remember where now.

And it sparked some good discussion.  Everyone *was* happy with the
game and how it was going but, even though we didn't change anything,
it was useful to confirm that everyone was still on the same page.

Then the other [abbr:gm] in the group asked the same questions about
*their* game a week later, which sparked a discussion about character
advancement and how *I* was a little dissatisfied with some aspects of
how we'd been handling it.  One day I'll write my thoughts on that up
as a post.

Are you running a long game?  Check in with your players to see if
your expectations are still aligned.  A year or more is a long time
since that initial session 0 discussion.
