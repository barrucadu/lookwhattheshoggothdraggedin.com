I put together a Tube-style map of the rudishva domain in [Arden Vul][] and some
people liked it:

![A Tube-style map of the Rudishva Domain][img]

It shows all the teleporters, numbered (including the two broken teleporters in
8-157), along with the two means of rapid vertical transportation (the Transit
Shaft and the Great Pillar), and major walking routes.  Locations on the
Midnight Road are coloured pink, Pods of the Beacon yellow, and other major
locations white.

To keep it compact I merged a few rooms, and I'm not totally happy with some of
the walking routes, but it's good enough.

If you want to edit it for yourself, [here's the draw.io source file][src].
