Some parts of a game exist in "the fiction".  This is the stuff that
characters can talk about.  Like their equipment, or a wizard's spell
slots (a wizard knows that they can only prepare certain combinations
of spells a day), or that a character has been knighted.

Some things are *not* like that.  This is the stuff that we as players
can talk about, but the characters can't.  Like dice rolls, the genre
of the game, and experience points.

These [glo:diegesis "non-diegetic"] things are still related to the
fiction, but they're an abstraction so that we can play the game.  For
example, Grog the Barbarian might know that Mazirian the Wizard is
smarter than they are, or that Aragorn the Ranger is more dexterous,
but none of those characters know exactly *how* smart or *how*
dexterous they are: the attribute differences are [glo:diegesis
"diegetic"], but the exact scores are not.

You need a mixture of both [glo:diegesis "diegetic"] and [glo:diegesis
"non-diegetic"] mechanics to keep things fun.

## Diegetic Character Advancement

Since Emmy Allen wrote [her first post on diegesis][], countless blog
posts have been written on how to make mechanics *more [glo:diegesis
"diegetic"]* (and here's another one).  Character advancement usually
gets picked on, because the typical form of character advancement is
incredibly [glo:diegesis "non-diegetic"]!

Here's your typical character advancement system, broken down into two
parts:

> **When** you gain enough experience points *(the trigger)*, **then**
> your character level increases by one and you gain your
> class-specific levelling bonuses *(the advancement)*.

The trigger isn't [glo:diegesis "diegetic"]---characters can talk
about their experiences, but experience *points* are a purely
out-of-game concept---and neither is the advancement.

Even worse, the advancement isn't connected to the trigger at all!  No
matter how you gained those experience points, you get the same
advancement.

Your typical [glo:diegesis "diegetic"] advancement instead looks like
this:

> **When** your character does some specific thing *(the trigger)*,
> **then** they receive an appropriate reward *(the advancement)*.

So a diegetic equivalent of your usual "level up and get better at
everything" could be:

> **When** you seek out training in a skill, **then** you increase
> your skill bonus by one.

That trigger might be a more nuanced, for example the training might
require you to demonstrate some degree of proficiency in the skill
first, or paying a sum of money, or going on a quest.  The key is that
the trigger is something directly expressed in the fiction.  It's
[glo:diegesis "diegetic"].  And, even better, the advancement is
connected to the trigger.  The reward is appropriate.  Two characters
who advance by doing different things will become different people.

You're almost certainly used to [glo:diegesis "diegetic"] advancement
already.  We've all seen things like this before:

- **When** you defeat the Elite Four, **then** you are given the title
  of "Pokemon Champion" and all of its privileges.
- **When** you gain the friendship and trust of a king, **then** you
  are invited to become a lord of his domain.
- **When** you complete a challenging contract, **then** your
  reputation grows and you will be trusted with more important
  contracts.

Unlike just levelling up when you amass enough experience points, the
[glo:gm] has to come up with these [glo:diegesis "diegetic"]
advancements.  But since these often tie into character goals, you can
ask your players what sort of things they're looking forward to and
give them opportunities to advance in that way.

### Why don't we have both?

[glo:diegesis "Diegesis"] and mechanics aren't opposed, and I don't
want to give the impression that one is necessarily better than the
other.  You could make rules to handle all of those things, for
example, you might introduce a reputation system to determine how
likely the characters are to meet a new patron.

But I think looking at things in this way is another tool you can use
to identify areas where your game is lacking.

If you *only* have [glo:diegesis "non-diegetic"] advancement, then
your players might feel like whatever they do doesn't really have any
impact.  If the only way their characters grow is by amassing
experience points, then they could go about that in any old way.  But
if they get unique gear, if [glos:npc] start to recognise them, if a
festival is held in their honour, then they're more than just killing
machines.

But if you *only* have [glo:diegesis "diegetic"] advancement, you
could run the risk of frustrating players who enjoy the system mastery
side of the game, if your advancement is also *non-mechanical*.  To
such players, it can feel like their characters *have a lot of stuff*
but they're not really *improving*: take away the stuff, and you have
the same character you did in the very first session.

## What I like

Personally, the form of advancement I find most satisfying is
[glo:diegesis "diegetic"] and mechanical at the same time, with the
advancement being related to the trigger.  I think [glo:coc] does this
to some degree, where you can only improve in a skill if you're used
it or found someone to teach you:

- The trigger is [glo:diegesis "diegetic"]: you have to actually do a
  thing (use a skill or find a mentor)
- The advancement is mechanical: you get better at the skill.
- And the advancement is related to the trigger: you only get better
  at *that* skill, not any others.

I also enjoy it when there *isn't* a mechanical benefit for the
advancement, but I wouldn't be satisfied if a game *only* featured
non-mechanical advancements.

Something I don't enjoy so much is a system where the advancement is
not connected to the trigger.  This tends to be the case in
level-based games.  For example, when a wizard levels up in [glo:dnd],
they learn some new spells.  Which new spells?  Well, whatever ones
you want!  As written, you don't need to seek out training, and in
fact you just learn the new spells overnight.

I can deal with this, but I'd *prefer* it if levelling up in [glo:dnd]
and similar games wasn't so sudden, where reaching the required number
of experience points to level up meant that you could then go seek out
the training to do so, spend a few in-game weeks or months improving,
and then by the time of the next session you've levelled up.  A time
skip, to explain why the character improves in a bunch of ways at
once.

So, if you're running a long campaign, but your players don't seem
satisfied with how their characters are advancing, you might not be
giving them enough of a form of advancement they enjoy.
