![This is the data I can see.](files/privacy/analytics.png)

Anonymous analytics are recorded on every page view, and may in the
future be recorded on specific events of interest.  If I implement
that, the events will be listed here.

No <abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr> is
collected.  No cookies are used.  And no cross-site tracking is done.
